    "dc_description_s": "This data set is a digital soil survey and generally is the most detailed level of soil geographic data developed by the National Cooperative Soil Survey. The information was prepared by digitizing maps, by compiling information onto a planimetric correct base and digitizing, or by revising digitized maps using remotely sensed and other information. This data set consists of georeferenced digital map data and computerized attribute data. The map data are in a soil survey area extent format and include a detailed, field verified inventory of soils and miscellaneous areas that normally occur in a repeatable pattern on the landscape and that can be cartographically shown at the scale mapped. A special soil features layer (point and line features) is optional. This layer displays the location of features too small to delineate at the mapping scale, but they are large enough and contrasting enough to significantly influence use and management. The soil map units are linked to attributes in the National Soil Information System relational database, which gives the proportionate extent of the component soils and their properties. The soil map unit delineation boundaries are subject to a cartographic standard of 19 ground meters of separation. Boundary separation is less than 19 meters in some park areas located in the Bronx River Watershed area, which reflects the high resolution of resource concern and management there. Compared to previous nonproject (non-SSURGO-certified) mapping that was conducted at 1:6,000 in the Bronx River Watershed area, the 1:12,000 scale mapping will appear to have less detail. However, the 1:12,000 SSURGO product represents the largest-scale official soils data published by the USDA-NRCS, and supersedes nonproject mapping at larger scales that appears to provide greater detail. In the process of correlating the mapping to a smaller scale, individual map unit delineations were combined (into complexes) and some features, especially wetter areas, small water bodies, or very narrow features (e.g. short steep slopes or escarpments), may be represented by special features (in the ?*_p? and ?*_l? feature classes). For more information regarding nonproject surveys in New York City, please visit: http://www.nycswcd.net/soil_survey.cfm  SSURGO depicts information about the kinds and distribution of soils on the landscape. The soil map and data used in the SSURGO product were prepared by soil scientists as part of the National Cooperative Soil Survey.",
