      <abstract>The Tompkins County Planning Department produced a land
                use and land cover data set of Tompkins County, NY in 1995 and
                in 2009 updated the data using the 2007 natural color
                ortho-imagery. Further updates were made in 2012. The need for
                this data set has been identified by various county departments,
                local municipal agencies, and other not-for-profit
                organizations. High resolution natural color digital
                orthoimagery acquired from the NYS Office of Cyber Security and
                Critical Infrastructure Coordination (CSCIC), and a number of
                other secondary digital data sources (wetlands, hydrology, tax
                parcel and planimetric base data) were used to interpret and
                delineate land use and land cover directly on-screen. The land
                use and land cover classification system that was designed for
                the 1995 project to meet the needs of the users of these data
                was used for the 2007 data. In 1968, the Land Use and Natural
                Resource Inventory (LUNR) a state-wide land use and land cover
                mapping project, used aerial photographs to identify 130 land
                use and land cover classes. The Tompkins County land use and
                land cover classification system has been designed to be
                comparable with the LUNR classification system. Comparable
                classification systems will enable users to analyze changes in
                land use and land cover over the previous thirty year time
                period.</abstract>
      <purpose>Provides a county-wide data set of all land use and land
                cover classes in Tompkins County. Potential uses of these data
                include land use and land cover time change analysis,
                comprehensive planning and development suitability
                analysis.</purpose>
      <supplinf>This data set is derived from the interpretation and
                delineation of land use and land cover from high-resolution
                natural-color digital orthoimages.</supplinf>
