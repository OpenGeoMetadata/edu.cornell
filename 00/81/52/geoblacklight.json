    "dc_description_s": "Tax parcel boundaries in Tompkins County for 2011 plus selected information added from the Tompkins County real property services (RPS) database for web applications. The boundaries represent the one-to-one match (GIS and RPS) with the parcel boundaries shown on the final paper maps for the given year. This version is mainly used for web-based applications where there is a live link to the extensive RPS data via imagemate online.  The parcel boundaries represent legal descriptions of property ownership, as recorded in various public documents in the Tompkins County Clerk's Office. This is a trimmed-down version of the Taxparcelrps database for web application use (on the Tompkins County website).",
