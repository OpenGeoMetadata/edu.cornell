      <abstract>CUGIR, the Cornell University Geospatial Information Repository, using US Department
        of Commerce, Bureau of the Census data, developed the GIS data set versions of 1990 Census
        TIGER/Line files for 5 coverages for each of the 62 counties in New York State.</abstract>
      <purpose>These files were developed to enable a user to see the geographic component from 1990
        TIGER/Line Census files. They can be used to join demographic data for use in conjunction
        with other Census data in geographic and demographic analysis.</purpose>
      <supplinf>To find out more about TIGER/Line files and other Census TIGER data base derived
        data sets visit "TIGER®, TIGER/Line® and TIGER-Related Products" of the Census Bureau at:

    <attracc>
      <attraccr>Original TIGER/Line data is accurate against Federal Processing Standards (FIPS),
        FIPS Publication 6-4 and FIPS-55 at the 100% level for the codes and base names. The
        remaining attribute information has been examined but has not been fully tested for
        accuracy. The digital files fro the Census Bureau were converted into shapefiles. The
        attributes supllied in the TIGER files have not been changed by CUGIR. Refer to "Chapter 5"
        and "Chapter 6" in the U.S. Census Bureau TIGER/Line file Technical Documentation, available at
        &lt;https://assets.nhgis.org/original-data/gis/TIGER_1992_TechDoc.pdf&gt;</attraccr>
    </attracc>
    <logic>According to TIGER/Line documentation: the feature network of lines (as represented by
      Record Types 1 and 2) is complete for census purposes. Spatial objects in TIGER/Line belong to
      the "Geometry and Topology" (GT) class of objects in the "Spatial Data Transfer Standard"
      (SDTS) FIPS publication 173 and are topologically valid. Node/geometry and topology
      (GT)-polygon/chain relationships are collected or generated to satisfy topological edit
      requirements. These requirements include: -Complete chains must begin and end at nodes;
      -Complete chains must connect to each other at nodes, -Complete chains do not extend through
      nodes; -Left and right GT-polygons are defined for each complete chain element and are
      consistent throughout the extract process; -The chains representing the limits of the files
      are free of gaps. The Census Bureau performed automated tests to ensure logical consistency
      and limits of files. All polygons are tested for closure.</logic>
    <complete>Data completeness of the TIGER/Line files reflects the contents of the Census TIGER
      data base at the time the TIGER/Line files (1990 version) were created.1990 Census TIGER/Line
      files are primarily based on the USGS 1:1000,000 scale Digital Line Graph files. Refer to the
      Technical documentation for features that are not present.</complete>

      <procstep>
        <procdesc>In order for others to use the information in the Census TIGER data base in a GIS
          or for other geographic applications, the Census Bureau releases periodic extracts of
          selected information from the Census TIGER data base, organized as topologically
          consistent networks. Software (TIGER DB routines) written by the Geography Division allows
          for efficient access to Census TIGER system data. TIGER/Line files are extracted from the
          Census TIGER data base by county or statistical equivalent area. Census TIGER data for a
          given county or statistical equivalent area is then distributed among 17 fixed length
          record ASCII files, each one containing attributes for either line, polygon, or landmark
          geographic data types. The Bureau of the Census has released various versions of the
          TIGER/Line files since 1988, with each version having more updates (feature and feature
          names, address ranges and ZIP Codes, coordinate updates, revised field definitions, etc.)
          than the previous version. Information concerning steps taken to create TIGER/Line is
          available in "Chapter 5: Data Quality" in TIGER/Line file Documentation, available at
          &lt;https://assets.nhgis.org/original-data/gis/TIGER_1992_TechDoc.pdf&gt;.</procdesc>

      <procstep>
        <procdesc>The 1990 TIGER shapefiles were downloaded originally from the Geography Network
          &lt;http://www.geographynetwork.com&gt;. Each Census hierarchical level (County, Tract,
          Block Group, and Block) was joined to it's associated SF1 demographics database table,
          also downloaded from the Geography Network. A VBA script was written within ArcGIS 8.2
          (ArcInfo) to automate the process of joining each county level file with its demographic
          table, and then exporting with unique file names. This process was done 4 times, one for
          each of the Census geographies. For the remaining TIGER data, (all but the boundary files)
          all files were originally downloaded from Geography Network, renamed and added to CUGIR
          with no further processing.</procdesc>

    <overview>
      <eaover>The TIGER/Line files contain data describing three major types of features/entities;
        Line Features: 1) Roads; 2) Railroads; 3) Hydrography; 4) Miscellaneous transportation
        features and Selected power lines and pipe lines; 5) Political and statistical boundaries.
        Landmark Features: 1) Point landmarks, e.g., schools and churches; 2) Area landmarks, e.g.,
        Parks and cemeteries; 3) Key geographic locations (KGLs), e.g., apartment buildings and
        factories. Polygon features: 1) Geographic entity codes for areas used to tabulate the 1990
        census statistical data and current geographic areas; 2) Locations of area landmarks 3)
        Locations of KGLs. The line features and polygon information form the majority of data in
        the TIGER/Line files. Some of the data/attributes describing the lines include coordinates,
        feature identifiers (names), CFCCs (used to identify the most noticeable characteristic of a
        feature), address ranges, and geographic entity codes. The TIGER/Line files contain point
        and area labels that describe landmark features and provide locational reference. Area
        landmarks consist of a feature name or label and feature type assigned to a polygon or group
        of polygons. Landmarks may overlap or refer to the same set of polygons. The Census TIGER
        data base uses collections of spatial objects (points, lines, and polygons) to model or
        describe real-world geography. The Census Bureau uses these spatial objects to represent
        features such as streets, rivers, and political boundaries and assigns</eaover>

        Bureau of the Census, TIGER/Line file Technical Documentation, available at
        &lt;https://assets.nhgis.org/original-data/gis/TIGER_1992_TechDoc.pdf&gt;. The TIGER/Line
        documentation defines the terms and definitions used within the files.</eadetcit>
