Coverages are based on official New York State Freshwater Wetlands Maps as described in Article 24-0301 of the Environmental Conservation Law. Coverages are not, however, a legal substitute for the official maps. Coverages are available on a county basis for all areas of New York State outside the Adirondack Park.  To provide a faithful representation of official New York State regulatory freshwater wetlands maps for GIS resource analysis at scales equal to the 1 to 24,000 scale of original mapping or smaller scales (e.g., 1 to 100,000 scale).",
