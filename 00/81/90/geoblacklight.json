    "dc_description_s": "This is derived from land use/land cover digital data collected by USGS and coverted to ARC/INFO by the EPA. This data is useful for environmental assessment of land use patterns with respect to water quality analysis, growth management, and other types of environmental impact assessment. Use may be limited due to currency. Land use and land cover data (LU/LC) collected by USGS NMD is useful for environmental assessment of land use patterns with respect to water quality analysis, growth management, and other types of environmental impact assessment. Data are meant to be used by quadrangle, or among adjacent quadrangles where temporarily contiguous. Can be used in any geographic application where intermediate scale land use data are appropriate and the dates are representative.  The purpose of the original files was to convert GIRAS data into EPA's standard GIS software. For use with other demographic and spatial data.",
