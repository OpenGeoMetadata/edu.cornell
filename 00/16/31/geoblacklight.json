Soil associations are groupings of two of three soil types that are considered similar enough, or are commonly found together on the landscape, so as to represent a somewhat uniform set of characteristics. Soil association maps go beyond soil surveys by aggregating soil series into larger geographical areas, thereby allowing more general or broader scale applications.",
