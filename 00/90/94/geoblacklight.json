    "dc_description_s": "This point dataset represents trees on the Cornell University main campus in Ithaca, New York as of 2016. This dataset is a partial update of the 2012 Campus Tree Inventory. The central area of campus was reinventoried in 2016. Existing trees were remeasured (see the DBH_2016 and Spread2016 fields) and, in some cases, more precisely located. New trees were added. Trees removed since the 2012 survey are noted in a supplemental shapefile.  The dataset provides an inventory of trees in the non-natural areas of the main Cornell Campus. This inventory can be used to support studies of species diversity, tree size and health, risks of invasive pests, and carbon sequestration.",
