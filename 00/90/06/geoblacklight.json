    "dc_description_s": "The National Land Cover Database 2011 (NLCD2011) USFS percent tree canopy product was produced through a cooperative project conducted by the Multi-Resolution Land Characteristics (MRLC) Consortium (www.mrlc.gov). The MRLC Consortium is a partnership of federal agencies, consisting of the U.S. Geological Survey, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) National Agricultural Statistics Service, the U.S. Forest Service, the National Park Service, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the Bureau of Land Management, NASA, and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. One of the primary goals of the project was to generate current, consistent, and seamless national land cover, percent tree canopy, and percent impervious cover at medium spatial resolution. This product is the cartographic version of the NLCD2011 percent tree canopy cover dataset for CONUS at medium spatial resolution (30 m). It was produced by the USDA Forest Service Remote Sensing Applications Center (RSAC). Tree canopy values range from 0 to 100 percent. The analytic tree canopy layer was produced using a Random Forests\u2122 regression algorithm. The cartographic product is a filtered version of the regression algorithm output.  The goal of this project is to provide the Nation with complete, current and consistent public domain information on its tree canopy cover.",
