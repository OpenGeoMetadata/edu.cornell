    "dc_description_s": "This statewide shapefile represents geographic boundaries for lands that are under the protection of NYS Agricultural District Law, administered by the New York State Department of Agriculture and Markets. The boundaries are derived from New York State Agricultural District, 1:24,000-scale, maps produced at county agencies. The district boundaries correspond to tax parcel data. District boundaries are joined into a file representing all of the Agricultural Districts within an entire county. Note that 2003 legislation allows lands to be added to districts on an annual basis. Electronic data provided here may predate those additions. When annual additions are included, an additional field (OEadds303b) is annexed to the attribute table; the dates of the annual additions listed in that field. Tax parcel detail and secondary rights-of-way are not included in this dataset. Rights-of-way for state and federal highways, railroads and utilities are only included when they are delineated on the original 1:24,000 scale maps.  A Geographic Information System file intended to represent the lands within agricultural district. Please note that boundaries may be generalizations; precise information can be obtained from the county or town tax parcel information.",
