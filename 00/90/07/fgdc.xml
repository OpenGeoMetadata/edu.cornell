      <abstract>The National Land Cover Database 2011 (NLCD2011) percent tree canopy cover (TCC
        2011) layer was produced through a cooperative project conducted by the Multi-Resolution
        Land Characteristics (MRLC) Consortium (www.mrlc.gov). The MRLC Consortium is a partnership
        of federal agencies, consisting of the U.S. Geological Survey, the National Oceanic and
        Atmospheric Administration, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the U.S. Department of
        Agriculture (USDA) National Agricultural Statistics Service, the U.S. Forest Service, the
        National Park Service, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the Bureau of Land Management,
        NASA, and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. One of the primary goals of the project was to
        generate a current, consistent, and seamless national land cover, percent tree canopy cover,
        and percent impervious cover at medium spatial resolution. TCC 2011 is the NLCD tree canopy
        cover dataset for CONUS at medium spatial resolution (30 m). It was produced by the USDA
        Forest Service Remote Sensing Applications Center (RSAC). The TCC 2011 dataset has two
        layers: percent tree canopy cover and standard error. For the tree canopy cover layer, the
        pixel values range from 0 to 100 percent. For the standard error layer, the pixel values
        range from 0 to 45 percent. The standard error represents the model uncertainty associated
        with the corresponding pixel in the tree canopy cover layer. The tree canopy cover layer was
        produced using a Random Forests™ regression algorithm and the standard error layer was
        calculated from the variance of the canopy cover estimates from the random forest regression
        trees.</abstract>
      <purpose>The goal of this project is to provide the Nation with complete, current and
        consistent public domain information on its tree canopy cover.</purpose>

      <attraccr>No formal independent accuracy assessment of TCC 2011 has been made. The Random
        Forests™ regression algorithm (Breiman 2001; Cutler et al. 2007) employed in TCC 2011
        mapping calculates the mean of squared residuals along with percent variability explained by
        the model for assessing prediction reliability. The Random Forests™ models consisted of 500
        decision trees, which were used to determine the final response value. The response of each
        tree depended on a randomly chosen subset of predictor variables chosen independently (with
        replacement) for evaluation by that tree. The responses of the trees were averaged to obtain
        an estimate of the dependent variable. The standard error is the square root of the variance
        of the estimates given by all trees. A summary of the Random Forests™ models is available in
        the supplemental metadata.</attraccr>

    <complete>This CONUS TCC 2011 product is the percent tree canopy layer version 1, dated 2014.
      The CONUS TCC 2011 dataset consists of two main data products: (1) per-pixel tree canopy cover
      and (2) per-pixel standard error for the predicted tree canopy cover. A summary of all the
      Landsat images and the predictor variables that were used for modeling tree canopy cover using
      the Random Forests™ regression algorithm is available in the supplemental metadata. For

        <procdesc>Creation of Landsat composite. Fifteen Landsat 5 scenes were selected and
          processed for each WRS-2 path/row. Selected scenes were acquired between 2007 and 2011,
          with the majority evenly distributed between 2009, 2010 and 2011. The selection process
          favored scenes with minimal cloud cover and with MODIS-based NDVI values near the annual
          peak for the dominant forest cover type. Remaining clouds were removed using the Fmask
          tool (Zhu and Woodcock 2012). Six spectral bands (TM bands 1-5 and 7) within each scene
          were atmospherically corrected with dark object subtraction and transformed to surface
          reflectance (Chander et al. 2009; Chavez 1988). Each set of 15 6-band scenes was then
          combined to form a cloud-free composite image for the given path/row.</procdesc>

        <procdesc>Creation of percent tree canopy cover dataset (main process). For practical
          reasons, the NLCD 2011 percent tree canopy cover (TCC 2011) CONUS dataset was created
          piecewise in 68 zones, called “mapping areas”. Each mapping area was based on the zones
          defined in Homer and Gallant (2001), but extended to include the footprint of all WRS-2
          path/rows that intersected the given zone. Each mapping area included between 9 and 27
          WRS-2 path/rows. The final dataset is a mosaic of TCC 2011 for all CONUS WRS-2 path/rows.
          Five major steps were employed to map tree canopy cover: collection of reference data,
          acquisition and/or creation of predictor layers, calibration of Random Forests™ regression
          models for each mapping area using reference data and predictor layers, application of
          those models to predict per-pixel tree canopy cover across the entire mapping area, and
          creation of the CONUS-wide mosaic. The methodology is described further below and in
          Coulston et al. (2012). Reference data, consisting of estimated tree canopy cover at each
          of 63,008 FIA plot locations, were generated via photographic interpretation of high
          spatial resolution images acquired by the National Agricultural Inventory Program (NAIP).
          The reference data were collected and supplied by the USDA Forest Service Forest Inventory
          and Analysis (FIA) program. The spatial distribution of the sample points follows the FIA
          systematic grid (Brand et al. 2000). Predictor layers included Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper
          composite imagery and spectral derivatives thereof (NDMI, NDVI, and tasseled cap);
          elevation data and spatial derivatives thereof (slope and aspect, as well as sine and
          cosine of aspect); NLCD 2001 percent tree canopy cover; NLCD 2006 land cover; Bailey's
          eco-regions; and the focal standard deviation of each of the preceding layers except for
          land cover and eco-regions. Explicit location data were also included as predictor layers.
          The processes for creating the derived layers are described separately (see related
          Process Steps). Modeling was carried out using the Random Forests™ (Breiman 2001) data
          mining technique as outlined in the Attribute Accuracy Report above. To minimize the root
          mean square error, variable importance information obtained from the Random Forests™
          models was used to reduce the number of predictor variables. These reduced datasets were
          used for the final Random Forests™ modeling. The models developed for each mapping area
          were applied to individual WRS-2 path/rows within the mapping area, producing a 2-layered
          image. The first layer was the RandomForests™ estimate of tree canopy cover and the second
          layer was the standard error, which is the per-pixel square root of the variance of the
          Random Forests™ estimates from the individual trees. Since models were applied to each
          mapping area independently, there were multiple estimates for pixels in overlapping areas.
          For these pixels, the estimate with the lowest standard error was carried into the
          CONUS-wide mosaic.</procdesc>
