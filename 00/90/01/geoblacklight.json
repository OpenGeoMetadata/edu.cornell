    "dc_description_s": "This shapefile is an index of county-based mosaics of USGS topographic maps. Map images were derived from scans of USGS 7.5 minute quadrangle maps (Digital Raster Graphics) circa 2000. The images form a set of seamless tiles, 5,000 m on a side, from which the map collar information was removed. Images are GeoTIFF files in NAD83, UTM zone 18.  A DRG is useful as a source or background layer in a GIS, as a means to perform quality assurance on other digital products, and as a source for the collection and revision of DLG data.",
