      <abstract>
This data set is a digital soil survey and generally is the most
detailed level of soil geographic data developed by the National
Cooperative Soil Survey. The information was prepared by digitizing
maps, by compiling information onto a planimetric correct base
and digitizing, or by revising digitized maps using remotely
sensed and other information.

This data set consists of georeferenced digital map data and
computerized attribute data. The map data are in a soil survey area
extent format and include a detailed, field verified inventory
of soils and miscellaneous areas that normally occur in a repeatable
pattern on the landscape and that can be cartographically shown at
the scale mapped. A special soil features layer (point and line
features) is optional. This layer displays the location of features
too small to delineate at the mapping scale, but they are large
enough and contrasting enough to significantly influence use and
management. The soil map units are linked to attributes in the
National Soil Information System relational database, which gives
the proportionate extent of the component soils and their properties.
</abstract>
      <purpose>
SSURGO depicts information about the kinds and distribution of
soils on the landscape. The soil map and data used in the SSURGO
product were prepared by soil scientists as part of the National
Cooperative Soil Survey.
</purpose>
      <supplinf>
Digital versions of hydrography, cultural features, and other
associated layers that are not part of the SSURGO data set may be
available from the primary organization listed in the Point of
Contact.

This data set is not designed for use as a primary regulatory tool
in permitting or citing decisions, but may be used as a reference
source. This is public information and may be interpreted by
organizations, agencies, units of government, or others based on
needs; however, they are responsible for the appropriate

reassign to the Natural Resources Conservation Service any
authority for the decisions that they make. The Natural Resources
Conservation Service will not perform any evaluations of these maps
for purposes related solely to State or local regulatory programs.

Photographic or digital enlargement of these maps to scales greater
than at which they were originally mapped can cause misinterpretation
of the data. If enlarged, maps do not show the small areas of
contrasting soils that could have been shown at a larger scale. The
depicted soil boundaries, interpretations, and analysis derived from
them do not eliminate the need for onsite sampling, testing, and
detailed study of specific sites for intensive uses. Thus, these data
and their interpretations are intended for planning purposes only.
Digital data files are periodically updated. Files are dated, and
users are responsible for obtaining the latest version of the data.

The attribute accuracy is tested by manual
comparison of the source with hard copy plots and/or symbolized
display of the map data on an interactive computer graphic system.
Selected attributes that cannot be visually verified on plots or
on screen are interactively queried and verified on screen. In
addition, the attributes are tested against a master set of valid
attributes. All attribute data conform to the attribute codes in
the signed classification and correlation document and amendment(s).

    <logic>
Certain node/geometry and topology GT- polygon/chain relationships
are collected or generated to satisfy topological requirements
(the GT-polygon corresponds to the soil delineation). Some of these
requirements include: chains must begin and end at nodes, chains
must connect to each other at nodes, chains do not extend through
nodes, left and right GT-polygons are defined for each chain
element and are consistent throughout, and the chains representing
the limits of the file are free of gaps. The tests of logical
consistency are performed using vendor software. All internal
polygons are tested for closure with vendor software and are checked
on hard copy plots. All data are checked for common soil lines (i.e.,
adjacent polygons with the same label). Edge locations generally do
not deviate from centerline to centerline by more than 0.01 inch.

The quadrangles in this survey are edge matched to quadrangles in
adjacent SSURGO certified soil surveys of Hamilton County, Jefferson
County and Akwesasne Territory: St. Regis Mohawk Reservation, New York, and
the survey area boundaries match.

Most feature edges (polygon and line segments) match adjacent ones in
the edge matched survey areas, however, most feature labels don't match
the adjacent feature labels in edge matched surveys.

Descriptive attributes (tabular information about the polygons and line
segments) were developed specifically for each survey area.  Although
most don't match exactly, the descriptive attributes of most polygon
and line segments in this survey are nearly the same as adjacent ones
in edge matched soil surveys.

A map unit is a collection of areas defined and named in terms of
their soil components or miscellaneous areas or both. Each map
unit differs in some respect from all others in a survey area and
each map unit has a symbol that uniquely identifies the map unit
on a soil map. Each individual area, point, or line so identified
on the map is a delineation.

Soil Scientists identify small areas of soils or miscellaneous areas
that have properties and behavior significantly different than the
named soils in the surrounding map unit. These minor components
may be indicated as special features. If they have a minimal effect
on use and management, or could not be precisely located, they may
not be indicated on the map.

A map unit has specified kinds of soils or miscellaneous areas
(map unit components), each with a designated range in
proportionate extent. Map units include one or more kinds of soil
or miscellaneous area. Miscellaneous areas are areas that have little
or no recognizable soil.

Specific National Cooperative Soil Survey standards and procedures
were used in the classification of soils, design and name of map
units, and location of special soil features. These standards are
outlined in Agricultural Handbook 18, Soil Survey Manual, 1993,
USDA, NRCS; Agricultural Handbook 436, Soil Taxonomy, 1995,
USDA, NRCS; and all Amendments; Keys to Soil Taxonomy,
(current issue) USDA, NRCS; National Soil Survey
Handbook, title 430-VI,(current issue) USDA, NRCS.

The actual composition and interpretive purity of the map unit
delineations were based on data collected by scientists during
the course of preparing the soil maps. Adherence to National
Cooperative Soil Survey standards and procedures is based on
peer review, quality control, and quality assurance. Quality
control is outlined in the memorandum of understanding for the
soil survey area and in documents that reside with the Natural
Resources Conservation Service state soil scientist. Four kinds
of map units are used in soil surveys: consociations, complexes,
associations, and undifferentiated groups.

Consociations - Consociations are named for the dominant soil.
In a consociation, delineated areas use a single name from the
dominant component in the map unit. Dissimilar components are
minor in extent. The soil component in a consociation may be
identified at any taxonomic level. Soil series is the lowest
taxonomic level. A consociation that is named as a miscellaneous
area is dominantly that kind of area and minor components do not
significantly affect the use of the map unit. The total amount of
dissimilar inclusions of other components in a map unit generally
does not exceed about 15 percent if limiting and 25 percent if
nonlimiting. A single component of a dissimilar limiting inclusion
generally does not exceed 10 percent if very contrasting.

Complexes and associations - Complexes and associations consist
of two or more  dissimilar components that occur in a regularly
repeating pattern. The total amount of other dissimilar components
is minor extent. The following arbitrary rule determines whether
complex or association is used in the name. The major components
of an association can be separated at the scale of mapping. In
either case, because the major components are sufficiently different
in morphology or behavior, the map unit cannot be called a
consociation. In each delineation of a complex or an association,
each major component is normally present though their proportions
may vary appreciably from one delineation to another. The total
amount of inclusions in a map unit that are dissimilar to any of
the major components does not exceed 15 percent if limiting and
25 percent if nonlimiting. A single kind of dissimilar limiting
inclusion usually does not exceed 10 percent.

Undifferentiated groups - Undifferentiated groups consist of two
or more components that are not consistently associated
geographically and, therefore, do not always occur together in
the same map delineation. These components are included in the
same named map unit because their use and management are the same
or very similar for common uses. Generally they are grouped together
because some common feature, such as steepness, stoniness, or
flooding, determines their use and management. If two or more
additional map units would serve no useful purpose, they may be
included in the same unit. Each delineation has at least one of the
major components, and some may have all of them. The same principles
regarding the proportion of minor components that apply to
consociations also apply to undifferentiated groups. The same
principles regarding proportion of inclusion apply to
undifferentiated groups as to consociations.

Minimum documentation consists of three complete soil profile
descriptions that are collected for each soil added to the legend,
one additional per 3,000 acres mapped; three 10 observation
transects for each map unit, one additional 10 point transect per
3,000 acres.

A defined standard or level of confidence in the interpretive
purity of the map unit delineations is attained by adjusting the
kind and intensity of field investigations. Field investigations
and data collection are carried out in sufficient detail to name
map units and to identify accurately and consistently areas of
about 39 acres for the less detailed soil survey (order 3 survey)
and about 2.5 acres for the more detailed soil survey (order 2 survey).

The accuracy of these digital data is based upon their
compilation to base maps that meet National Map
Accuracy Standards at a scale of 1 inch equals 1,000
feet. The difference in positional accuracy between the
soil boundaries and special soil features locations in the
field and their digitized map locations is unknown. The
locational accuracy of soil delineations on the ground varies
with the transition between map units.

For example, on long gently sloping landscapes the transition
occurs gradually over many feet. Where landscapes change
abruptly from steep to level, the transition will be very
narrow. Soil delineation boundaries and special soil features
generally were digitized within 0.01 inch of their locations on
the digitizing source. The digital map elements are edge matched
between data sets. The data along each quadrangle edge are
matched against the data for the adjacent quadrangle. Edge
locations generally do not deviate from centerline to centerline
by more than 0.01 inch.

The Soil Survey of St. Lawrence County, New York
began in 1973.  Field work was aided by the 1925 Soil Survey of St.
Lawrence County, New York and Conservation Plan Mapping that
occurred principally from 1962-1972.  A detailed evaluation was
done to determine how much of this early mapping was useful.  The
northern part (more detailed portion of the soil survey area)
1,100,000 acres of the county were mapped at a scale of 1:15840
scale.  The southern part (less detailed portion of the soil survey
area) of the county was mapped at a scale of 1:62500 scale.  The
soil survey concluded in July, 1990 with a final correlation that
finalized the classification and map unit names.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture, Natural
Resources Conservation Service, National Cartography and Geospatial
Center, Fort Worth, Texas, used a photographic process to prepare
stable-base orthophotoquad positives from orthophotographs for
compilation.   These were prepared for the more detailed portion of
the soil survey area of the survey area at scale 1:24000.  These
1:24000 orthophotoquads were mosaicked together to create a 15
minute orthophotoquad film positive at 1:62500 scale for use in the
less detailed soil survey area.

For the more detailed portion of the survey
area, ratioed film positives at 1:24000 scale, were produced from
the 1:15840 scale field sheets.  The special soil features
data, on the ratioed film positives, were compiled to the
orthophotoquad film positives onto a stable-base scan overlay.
The compilation was completed by Natural Resources Conservation
Service, Pennsylvania Compilation Unit, State College,
Pennsylvania.

For the less detailed portion of the survey
area, the 1:62500 aerial photo field sheets were compiled to
1:62500 orthophotoquad film positives by soil scientists from
the Natural Resources Conservation Service in New York.  This
annotated orthophotoquad was later enlarged photographically to
1:24000 scale, and was recompiled to a 1:24000 orthophotoquad film
positive onto a stable-base scan overlay.  This recompilation was
performed by the Natural Resources Conservation Service at West
Virginia compilation unit in Summersville, West Virginia.

The digitizing of the soil and special soil
features data for the more detailed portion of the survey area
was completed by contract administered by the Natural Resources
Conservation Service, National Cartography and Geospatial Center,
Fort Worth, Texas.  The contractor used custom software for data
capture and export in Digital Line Graph Optional format.  The data
were created and maintained in the North American Datum of 1927.
The county boundaries were manually digitized from the 7.5 minute
USGS topographic quadrangles.  The digital maps of soil lines and
special soil features were reviewed by the Natural Resources
Conservation Service, National Cartography and Geospatial Center,
SSURGO Support Section imported the data for verification in
ARC/INFO Version 7.1.4.  The data were edited.  Upon successful
completion of the SSURGO Evaluation, the DLGs were rewritten from
ARC/INFO Version 7.1.1 on a Sun UNIX Workstation.  The new ARC/INFO
version DLGs were rechecked with the October 1998 ARC/INFO SSURGO
Evaluation AMLs.  The DLGs were processed with the October 1998
archiving AMLs provided by National Cartography and Geospatial
Center, Fort Worth, Texas.

The 7.5 minute quadrangle soil map unit
delineation overlays for the less detailed portion of the survey
area were raster scanned by Midwest Graphics, Kenosha, Wisconsin
at 250 dpi on an Intergraph Anatech scanner in rlc format.  Four
control points corresponding to the four corners on the 7.5 minute
quadrangles were used for registration during data collection.  The
data were sent to the Bangor, Maine NRCS State Office.  The county
boundaries were manually digitized from the 7.5 minute USGS
topographic quadrangles in LT4X Version 4.11 on a Sun UNIX
Workstation.  The special soil features were manually digitized
from the scanning source in LT4X at a resolution of 0.01 inch.  The
raster editing, labeling, edge matching, vector conversion were done
in LT4X Version 4.11. Check plots of the soils and special soil
features were reviewed by a soil scientist. The soils and special
soil features files were exported to Digital Line Graph-3 Optional

format files directly out of LT4X Version 4.11.

U.S. Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation
Service, Wisconsin Digitizing Unit, Madison, Wisconsin for SSURGO
Evaluation.  The DLG-3 Optional format files were evaluated with
the October 1998 ARC/INFO Evaluation AMLs provided by U.S.
Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation Service,
National Cartography and Geospatial Center, Fort Worth, Texas.  The
DLGs and tabular data of the more detailed portion of St. Lawrence
County were download and merged with the less detailed portion.
The files were evaluated with October 1998 ARC/INFO Evaluation AMLs
provided by National Cartography and Geospatial Center.  Upon
successful completion of the SSURGO Evaluation, the DLGs were
rechecked with the October 1998 ARC/INFO SSURGO Evaluation AMLs.

The online SSURGO data were imported into
ARC/INFO Version 7.2.1 at the Natural Resources Conservation
Service, Wisconsin Digitizing Unit.  Digital edits were made to
approximately 75% of the survey for mapfinishing purposes.  The
data were then processed with the revised Oct. 1998 ARC/INFO
AML's.  Minor codes were replaced to link spatial data map units
to the National Soil Information System (NASIS) database. Map
unit acres from the spatial data were used to populate the
NASIS database developed by NRCS soil scientists according to
national standards.  New DLGs were written from the edited
spatial data and, along with the NASIS SSURGO download tabular
data, were processed with April 2001 archiving AML's provided
by National Cartography and Geospatial Center Fort Worth,
Texas (NCGC).  The certified data were then ftped to NCGC for
archival and distribution.

The spatial data for St. Lawrence County, New York soil survey area was
downloaded from the Soil Data Mart on October 15, 2012.  The individual
shapefiles were appended into a geodatabase for region 12.  The data were
processed in ARCGIS 10.1 using a topology object with a 0.1 meter cluster
tolerance for the purpose of eliminating gaps and overlaps within the
region 12 soils geodatabase.  Individual soil survey area data were
exported as shapefiles from the regional geodatabase.  A datum
transformation from NAD83 to WGS84 using the NAD_1983_To_WGS_1984_1 datum
transformation method was applied to the data.  The data were checked with
the SSURGO Evaluation scripts provided by U.S. Department of Agriculture,
Natural Resources Conservation Service. The shapefiles were then uploaded
to the soil data warehouse for archival and distribution.

Map Unit Delineations are closed polygons that may be dominated
by a single soil or miscellaneous area component plus allowable
similar or dissimilar soils, or they can be geographic mixtures
of groups of soils or soils and miscellaneous areas.

The map unit symbol uniquely identifies each closed map unit
delineation. Each symbol corresponds to a map unit name. The
map unit key is used to link to information in the National
Soil Information System tables.

Map Unit Delineations are described by the National Soil
Information System database. This attribute database gives the
proportionate extent of the component soils and the properties for
each soil. The database contains both estimated and measured data
on the physical and chemical soil properties and soil
interpretations for engineering, water management, recreation,
agronomic, woodland, range, and wildlife uses of the soil.

The National Soil Information System database contains static
metadata. It documents the data structure and includes such
information as what tables, columns, indexes, and relationships
are defined as well as a variety of attributes of each of these
database objects. Attributes include table and column
descriptions and detailed domain information.

The National Soil Information System database also contains a
distribution metadata. It records the criteria used for selecting
map units and components for inclusion in the set of distributed
data.

Special features are described in the feature table.  It includes an
area symbol, feature label, feature name, and feature description for
each special and ad hoc feature in the survey area.
