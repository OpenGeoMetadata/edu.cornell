    "dc_description_s": "This dataset is a digital representation of the King and Beikman map. In 1974 the U.S. Geological Survey published a new Geologic Map of the United States (exclusive of Alaska and Hawaii) on a scale of 1:2,500,000, which was compiled between 1967 and 1971 by Philip B. King and Helen M. Beikman, with geologic cartography by Gertrude J. Edmonston.  (from King and Beikman, 1974b) The map displays the rocky foundations on which our of investigation of this foundation by a succession of geologists. It is thus a reference work that present and future geologists of the country can consult and is of prime importance in the education of earth scientists in schools and colleges. Further, it can be consulted by geologists in other countries and continents who wish to learn about the geology of the United States; they will compare the map with similar national or continental maps of their own countries. In terms of resources useful to man, the Geologic Map lays out accurately the major regions of bedrock in New York State upon which many facets of our economy depend. It illustrates the areas of stratified rocks that are the sources of most of our fuels, and the areas of crystalline, plutonic, and volcanic rocks that contain important parts of mineral wealth. The map shows areas of complex folding and faulting, parts of which are still tectonically unstable and subject to earthquake hazards. To some extent the bedrock represented on the map also influences surface soils, which are of interest in agriculture and engineering works. Beyond this, the practical value of the map is less tangible, although it can be an important tool for the discerning user. Clearly, the map will not pinpoint the location of the next producing oil well or the next bonanza mine, nor will it give specific advice for the location of a dam or reactor site; these needs can only be satisfied by maps on much larger scales, designed for specific purposes. Nevertheless, the sapient exploration geologist can find upon it significant regional features not apparent to the untrained user. Many great petroleum pools occur in stratigraphic traps, or \"wedge belts of porosity,\" caused by overlap or truncation, the regional occurrence of which can be seen on the map. Important mineral deposits cluster along regional tectonic trends or chains of plutons of specific ages. Finally, the Geologic Map will be used in national planning activities in conjunction with other national maps showing environmental features such as climate, vegetation, and land use --for the location of power transmission corridors, highways, National Parks, wilderness areas, reclamation projects, and the like.",
