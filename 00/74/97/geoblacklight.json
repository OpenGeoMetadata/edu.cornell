The need for this data set has been identified by various county departments, local municipal agencies, and other not-for-profit organizations.  To provide a complete network of streams within the county boundaries and to add enough basic attributes that a fundamental degree of categorization would be achieved. To provide a stream layer for map production and to provide a framework for relating streams to external databases.",
