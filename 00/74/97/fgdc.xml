    <descript>
      <abstract>The Tompkins County Planning Department utilized inter-departmental mapping expertise of the Tompkins County Information Technology Services GIS Division to produce a data set of surface water features for Tompkins County, New York. The need for this data set has been identified by various county departments, local municipal agencies, and other not-for-profit organizations.</abstract>
      <purpose>To provide a complete network of streams within the county boundaries and to add enough basic attributes that a fundamental degree of categorization would be achieved. To provide a stream layer for map production and to provide a framework for relating streams to external databases.</purpose>
      <supplinf>Data originating from the Tompkins County 1991-92 Planimetric project at a scale of 1:4800 was organized into watersheds and edited to complete the connectivity of stream segments and networks. Identified gaps between arcs due to the original data capture errors were corrected with the use of secondary data sources. In locations where stream paths did not exist through water bodies and wetlands, additional segments, or artificial paths were added through these polygons. Approximate stream centerlines were also delineated in locations where larger streams were identified only by two arcs representing stream edges. In addition, all centerline segment directional orientation was altered to a downstream direction. Paper Maps can be ordered directly from Tompkins County IT/GIS. Attribute information can be found is the following attached files :Hydrology_attributes.xls and a HYDROLOGY_ATTRIBUTES.txt file</supplinf>

    <complete>For all stream segments that are part of the National Hydrography Dataset ("Comonid"), the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation's Water Index Number ("WIN") maps, regulation numbers (" Apt"), and the 303(d) list of Priority Water Bodies ("Priorityh2o") this data can be considered complete for Tompkins County. Because of the changing nature of stream flow and the gray area defining intermittent streams it would not be responsible to suggest that the data is complete for streams on the smaller end of the size continuum. We have been careful to include as many data sources as possible to incorperate them into the Hydrography dataset.</complete>
    <posacc>
      <horizpa>
        <horizpar>Varies, depending on source of Hydography data (Planimetric Base Map, DOQQÂ’s, aerial photo, raw conversion from paper maps, etc). The positional accuracy of each individual arc is determined by the source and status data for that arc found in the fields "Source" and "Status". More than 65% of the the data set tagged with the hyd and plan source attributes is limited to the accuracy of the 1991 Tompkins County Planimetric Base Map series. The centerlines and artificial paths (Ltype = scl and Ltype = ap) represents another 14% and the accuracy of these arcs is much less significant positionally since centerlines and artificial paths are only intended to represent an abstract paths of a streams passing through a lakes, reservoirs, ponds, wetlands. Arcs with a Source code other than "hyd" or an Ltype code of "ap" or "scl" are generally accurate to within plus or minus 30 feet.</horizpar>

            <othercit>This is an extensive revision of the "Unique Natural Areas of Tompkins County, 1990 Inventory". One hundred and ninety-two Unique Natural Areas are inventoried. Detailed information about each Unique Natural Area (site description, reason for selection, rating, protection status, water resources, physical characteristics, soils, conservation comments, cover type, vegetation/animal description, rare flora, and rare fauna) and an accurate site map of the UNA boundary is provided for each site.</othercit>

        <procdesc>1. Conduct needs assessment; 2. Devise a Stream Identification and Classification Systems and project specifications 3. Our primary planimetric Hydrography data source was generated by Michael Baker, Jr. Engineers; 4. Create an accurate watershed coverage and Divide the planimetric hydrography coverage into these defined watersheds for editing convienience; 5. Collect secondary data sources - In this case 1995 DOQQ's, 1999 aerial Photography, and field data collection on printed maps, 1:24000 USGS Topographic maps, DEC Water Index Maps, National Hydrography Dataset, Priority Waterbodies Dataset; 6. Interpret data from secondary data sources to complete gaps and omissions in planimetric data; 7. Digitally record data and add attributes; 8. Combine individual watersheds into a single coverage; 9. Edit attributes by selecting in ArcView and analyzing both linework and tablular data for completeness; 10. Check for attribute errors.</procdesc>

        <attrlabl>Tcid</attrlabl>
        <attrdef>A unique identifier assigned to all arcs in the county hydrography dataset with a line type equal to "s", "scl", or "ap". This identifier includes information about the watershed that it is a part of, it's relative location in that watershed, and whether or not it is included in the DEC, NHD, or Priority Water Bodies datasets.-Confluence to confluence reaches are consecutively lettered with lower case letters, tributaries are consecutively numbered, and capital letters are used to signify its inclusion in another data set. -The TCID code for each stream reach will begin with the name of the watershed that it is from. -Beginning at the confluence of the main stream, each tributary of that main stream is numbered consecutively as you progress up stream. -Tributaries to each of these tributaries will be consecutively numbered in an upstream direction until all tributaries are numbered. -This process of consecutively numbering tributaries of a stem tributary continues until all tributaries have received a number. - Reaches defined by the confluence of two tributaries will be consecutively lettered beginning at the mouth of the stream and progressing upstream, using lower case letters, beginning with "a" and if necessary starting over and progressing through "aa, ab" until you reach itÂ’s headwater reach. This process is repeated for consecutive reaches of each tributary until all confluence to confluence reaches have received a letter code. -For streams with headwaters outside of Tompkins County and with a confluence in Cayuga Lake, the coding system ends at the county boundary. -For streams with their headwaters in the county that eventually exit across the county boundary, coding for the portions outside the county boundary uses the NYS/DEC Water Index Number map to determine reaches. As the coding proceeds upstream past the county boundary the County Hydrography is used to identify reaches for coding. -If a reach is included in the state DEC stream data set, then the TCID will end in "S". -If a reach is included in the NHD, then the Tompkins County reach code will end with "N". -If a reach is included in the state Priority Water Bodies Inventory list, then the TCID for that reach will end in "P". -If a reach is included in both the DEC and the NHD data sources, then the TCID will end in "SN". ("SNP " will be used when a reach is included in all three data sources.) -If in the future a tributary is added to the county stream data set, it is given a decimal equivalent to its relative distance upstream to the next tributary. (ie. If a tributary were added approximately half way between tributaries 3 and 4, then the new tributary number would be 3.5) - When a reach is divided by the addition of a new tributary, a .1 and .2 decimal is added to the new reaches. .1 is added to the downstream reach and .2 is added to the upstream reach. (ie. If reach Salmon-f were divided the resulting reaches would be Salmon-f.1 and Salmon-f.2)</attrdef>

        <attrlabl>Watershed</attrlabl>
        <attrdef>The name of watershed is provided for all arcs. Watersheds are typically defined by a line that divides two adjacent stream systems or groups of smaller streams that flow into Cayuga Lake. A coverage exists that represents the watershed deliniations within Tompkins County and this coverage is the basis for the Hydrography watershed divisions.</attrdef>
