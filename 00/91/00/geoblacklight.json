    "dc_description_s": "This point dataset represents trees on the Cornell University main campus in Ithaca, New York as of 2019. This dataset is a partial update of the 2016 Campus Tree Inventory. West campus, central campus, and parts of north campus were reinventoried in 2019-2020. Existing trees were remeasured (see the DBH_2019 and Spread2020 fields) and, in some cases, more precisely located. New trees were added and others were removed.  The dataset provides an inventory of trees in the non-natural areas of the main Cornell Campus. This inventory can be used to support studies of species diversity, tree size and health, risks of invasive pests, and carbon sequestration.",
