    "dc_description_s": "This data set includes crushed stone operations in the United States. These data were obtained from information reported voluntarily to the USGS by the aggregate producing companies. The data represent commodities covered by the Minerals Information Team (MIT) of the U.S. Geological Survey, and the operations are those considered active in 1998 with production greater than 30,000 tons and surveyed by the MIT.  These data are intended for the geographic display and analysis at the national level, and for large regional areas. The data should be displayed and analyzed at scales appropriate for 1:2,000,000-scale data. No responsibility is assumed by the U.S. Geological Survey in the use of these data.",
