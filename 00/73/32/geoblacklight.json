    "dc_description_s": "This data set includes refractory, abrasive, and other industrial minerals operations in the United States. The data represent commodities covered by the Minerals Information Team (MIT) of the U.S. Geological Survey. The mineral operations are plants and/or mines considered active in 1997, or in 2001 bentonite and fire clay, and surveyed by the MIT. This file is an update of the 1998 data set.  These data are intended for geographic display and analysis at the national level, and for large regional areas. The data should be displayed and analyzed at scales appropriate for 1:2,000,000-scale data. No responsibility is assumed by the U.S. Geological Survey in the use of these data.",
