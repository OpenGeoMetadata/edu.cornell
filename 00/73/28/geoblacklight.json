    "dc_description_s": "This data set includes construction minerals operations in the United States. The data represent commodities covered by the Minerals Information Team (MIT) of the U.S. Geological Survey. The mineral operations are plants and/or mines considered active in 1997, or in 2001 for ball clay and common clay, and surveyed by the MIT. Excluded are construction sand and gravel and crushed stone. This file is an update of the 1998 data set.  These data are intended for geographic display and analysis at the national level, and for large regional areas. The data should be displayed and analyzed at scales appropriate for 1:2,000,000-scale data. No responsibility is assumed by the U.S. Geological Survey in the use of these data.",
