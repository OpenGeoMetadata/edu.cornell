This data set was collected using a different roads file from that available through the National Atlas of the United States.  The digital data sets are used to create electronic and hard copy maps of the Breeding Bird Survey routes. The data can be used to conduct geographic analysis on national and large regional scales. The data should be displayed and analyzed at scales appropriate for 1:100,000-scale data. No responsibility is assumed by the U.S. Geological Survey or by USGS Patuxent Wildlife Research Center in the use of these data.",
