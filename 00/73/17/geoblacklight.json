    "dc_description_s": "This data set contains the shallowest principal aquifers of New York State, portrayed as lines. The data set was developed as part of the effort to produce the maps published at 1:2,500,000 in the printed series \"Ground Water Atlas of the United States\". The published maps contain base and cultural features not included in these data. This data set was previously called Principal Aquifers of the 48 Contiguous United States.  These data are intended for use in publications, at a scale of 1:2,500,000 or smaller. Due to the small scale, the primary intended use is for regional and national data display and analysis, rather than specific local data analysis.",
