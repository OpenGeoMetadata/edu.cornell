      <abstract>
This data set is a digital soil survey and generally is the most
detailed level of soil geographic data developed by the National
Cooperative Soil Survey. The information was prepared by digitizing
maps, by compiling information onto a planimetric correct base
and digitizing, or by revising digitized maps using remotely
sensed and other information.

This data set consists of georeferenced digital map data and
computerized attribute data. The map data are in a soil survey area
extent format and include a detailed, field verified inventory
of soils and miscellaneous areas that normally occur in a repeatable
pattern on the landscape and that can be cartographically shown at
the scale mapped. A special soil features layer (point and line
features) is optional. This layer displays the location of features
too small to delineate at the mapping scale, but they are large
enough and contrasting enough to significantly influence use and
management. The soil map units are linked to attributes in the
National Soil Information System relational database, which gives
the proportionate extent of the component soils and their properties.
</abstract>
      <purpose>
SSURGO depicts information about the kinds and distribution of
soils on the landscape. The soil map and data used in the SSURGO
product were prepared by soil scientists as part of the National
Cooperative Soil Survey.
</purpose>
      <supplinf>
Digital versions of hydrography, cultural features, and other
associated layers that are not part of the SSURGO data set may be
available from the primary organization listed in the Point of
Contact.

Photographic or digital enlargement of these maps to scales greater
than at which they were originally mapped can cause misinterpretation
of the data. If enlarged, maps do not show the small areas of
contrasting soils that could have been shown at a larger scale. The
depicted soil boundaries, interpretations, and analysis derived from
them do not eliminate the need for onsite sampling, testing, and
detailed study of specific sites for intensive uses. Thus, these data
and their interpretations are intended for planning purposes only.
Digital data files are periodically updated. Files are dated, and
users are responsible for obtaining the latest version of the data.

The attribute accuracy is tested by manual
comparison of the source with hard copy plots and/or symbolized
display of the map data on an interactive computer graphic system.
Selected attributes that cannot be visually verified on plots or
on screen are interactively queried and verified on screen. In
addition, the attributes are tested against a master set of valid
attributes. All attribute data conform to the attribute codes in
the signed classification and correlation document and amendment(s).

Certain node/geometry and topology GT- polygon/chain relationships
are collected or generated to satisfy topological requirements
(the GT-polygon corresponds to the soil delineation). Some of these
requirements include: chains must begin and end at nodes, chains
must connect to each other at nodes, chains do not extend through
nodes, left and right GT-polygons are defined for each chain
element and are consistent throughout, and the chains representing
the limits of the file are free of gaps. The tests of logical
consistency are performed using vendor software. All internal
polygons are tested for closure with vendor software and are checked
on hard copy plots. All data are checked for common soil lines (i.e.,
adjacent polygons with the same label). Edge locations generally do
not deviate from centerline to centerline by more than 0.01 inch.

The Soil Survey of (NY037) Genesee County, New York is edge matched
to the adjacent SSURGO certified soil surveys:
NY029  Erie County, New York
NY051  Livingston County, New York
NY055  Monroe County, New York
NY073  Orleans County, New York
NY664  Niagara County Area, New York
NY121  Wyoming County, New York

Most feature edges (polygon and line segments) match adjacent ones in
the edge matched survey areas, however, most feature labels don't match
the adjacent feature labels in edge matched surveys.

Descriptive attributes (tabular information about the polygons and line
segments) were developed specifically for each survey area.  Although
most do not match exactly, the descriptive attributes of most polygon
and line segments in this survey are nearly the same as adjacent ones
in edge matched soil surveys.

A map unit is a collection of areas defined and named in terms of
their soil components or miscellaneous areas or both. Each map
unit differs in some respect from all others in a survey area and
each map unit has a symbol that uniquely identifies the map unit
on a soil map. Each individual area, point, or line so identified
on the map is a delineation.

Soil Scientists identify small areas of soils or miscellaneous areas
that have properties and behavior significantly different than the
named soils in the surrounding map unit. These minor components
may be indicated as special features. If they have a minimal effect
on use and management, or could not be precisely located, they may
not be indicated on the map.

A map unit has specified kinds of soils or miscellaneous areas
(map unit components), each with a designated range in
proportionate extent. Map units include one or more kinds of soil
or miscellaneous area. Miscellaneous areas are areas that have little
or no recognizable soil.

Specific National Cooperative Soil Survey standards and procedures
were used in the classification of soils, design and name of map
units, and location of special soil features. These standards are
outlined in Agricultural Handbook 18, Soil Survey Manual, 1993,
USDA, NRCS; Agricultural Handbook 436, Soil Taxonomy, 1995,
USDA, NRCS; and all Amendments; Keys to Soil Taxonomy,
(current issue) USDA, NRCS; National Soil Survey
Handbook, title 430-VI,(current issue) USDA, NRCS.

The actual composition and interpretive purity of the map unit
delineations were based on data collected by scientists during
the course of preparing the soil maps. Adherence to National
Cooperative Soil Survey standards and procedures is based on
peer review, quality control, and quality assurance. Quality
control is outlined in the memorandum of understanding for the
soil survey area and in documents that reside with the Natural
Resources Conservation Service state soil scientist. Four kinds
of map units are used in soil surveys: consociations, complexes,
associations, and undifferentiated groups.

Consociations - Consociations are named for the dominant soil.
In a consociation, delineated areas use a single name from the
dominant component in the map unit. Dissimilar components are
minor in extent. The soil component in a consociation may be
identified at any taxonomic level. Soil series is the lowest
taxonomic level. A consociation that is named as a miscellaneous
area is dominantly that kind of area and minor components do not
significantly affect the use of the map unit. The total amount of
dissimilar inclusions of other components in a map unit generally
does not exceed about 15 percent if limiting and 25 percent if
nonlimiting. A single component of a dissimilar limiting inclusion
generally does not exceed 10 percent if very contrasting.

Complexes and associations - Complexes and associations consist
of two or more  dissimilar components that occur in a regularly
repeating pattern. The total amount of other dissimilar components
is minor extent. The following arbitrary rule determines whether
complex or association is used in the name. The major components
of an association can be separated at the scale of mapping. In
either case, because the major components are sufficiently different
in morphology or behavior, the map unit cannot be called a
consociation. In each delineation of a complex or an association,
each major component is normally present though their proportions
may vary appreciably from one delineation to another. The total
amount of inclusions in a map unit that are dissimilar to any of
the major components does not exceed 15 percent if limiting and
25 percent if nonlimiting. A single kind of dissimilar limiting
inclusion usually does not exceed 10 percent.

Undifferentiated groups - Undifferentiated groups consist of two
or more components that are not consistently associated
geographically and, therefore, do not always occur together in
the same map delineation. These components are included in the
same named map unit because their use and management are the same
or very similar for common uses. Generally they are grouped together
because some common feature, such as steepness, stoniness, or
flooding, determines their use and management. If two or more
additional map units would serve no useful purpose, they may be
included in the same unit. Each delineation has at least one of the
major components, and some may have all of them. The same principles
regarding the proportion of minor components that apply to
consociations also apply to undifferentiated groups. The same
principles regarding proportion of inclusion apply to
undifferentiated groups as to consociations.

Minimum documentation consists of three complete soil profile
descriptions that are collected for each soil added to the legend,
one additional per 3,000 acres mapped; three 10 observation
transects for each map unit, one additional 10 point transect per
3,000 acres.

A defined standard or level of confidence in the interpretive
purity of the map unit delineations is attained by adjusting the
kind and intensity of field investigations. Field investigations
and data collection are carried out in sufficient detail to name
map units and to identify accurately and consistently areas of
about 3 acres.

The accuracy of these digital data is based upon their
compilation to base maps that meet National Map
Accuracy Standards at a scale of 1 inch equals 1,000
feet. The difference in positional accuracy between the
soil boundaries and special soil features locations in the
field and their digitized map locations is unknown. The
locational accuracy of soil delineations on the ground varies
with the transition between map units.

For example, on long gently sloping landscapes the transition
occurs gradually over many feet. Where landscapes change
abruptly from steep to level, the transition will be very
narrow. Soil delineation boundaries and special soil features
generally were digitized within 0.01 inch of their locations on
the digitizing source. The digital map elements are edge matched
between data sets. The data along each quadrangle edge are
matched against the data for the adjacent quadrangle. Edge
locations generally do not deviate from centerline to centerline
by more than 0.01 inch.

Genesee County had a previously published soil
survey, 1969, at 1:15840 scale  An evaluation was made of the soil
survey in 1997.  It was determined that the soil map unit
delineations and map unit components were accurate.

The soil survey of Genesee County, New York was
published in 1969.  A detailed evaluation revealed that while many
soil classifications have changed because of changes to soil
taxonomy, the soil polygons are accurately placed on the landscape.
An exception to this concerns deposits of organic soils in some
locations that are not as deep to underlying mineral soil material
as when these deposits were originally mapped for the published
soil survey.  Since the original mapping, subsidence and erosion
have decreased the thickness of the organic matter primarily in
areas where muck soils have been used for the production of cash
crops.  Where these organic deposits extend into Orleans County, no
attempt was made to join node for node or soil type to soil type.
This will be accomplished when updates are performed.  Another
exception involves polygons of gravel pit that are labeled with the
spot symbol for "Pits, gravel and other" and polygons of quarry
that are labeled with the spot symbol for "Mines and Quarries."
Since these are delineated polygons, the spot symbol labels are
inappropriate for the digitized soil layer.  Therefore,
a map unit of Gravel Pits with a SSURGO label of "Pt" and a map unit
of Quarry with a SSURGO label of "Qu", were added to the correlated
Soil Survey Legend of Genesee county for digitizing purposes.
Polygons labeled with a spot symbol for "Pits, gravel and other"
in the published soil survey, are labeled "Pt" in the digitized soil
survey.  Polygons labeled with a spot symbol for "Mines and
Quarries" in the published soil survey, are labeled "Qu" in the
digitized soil survey. Spot symbols used in the published soil survey
for "Pits, gravel or other" and for "Mines and Quarries" which are
not labels for polygons are in the special feature layer of the
digitized soil survey.

In the preparation of the compilation materials,
7.5 minute topographic quadrangle negatives representing the
various feature separates were photographically reproduced as
screened composites by USGS and were enlarged from 1:24000 scale
to 1:12000 scale negatives using large frame photographic
equipment.

The published 1:15840 scale maps from the Soil
Survey of Genesee County, New York were enlarged to 1:12000 scale
and copied to stable-base sheets.  These stable-base enlargements
were used as the source material for the soil map compilation.  The
soil polygon data on the 1;12000 scale photocopied stable-base
enlargements were manually compiled to 1:12000 scale, 3.75 minute
topographic quadrangle base.  The compilation was performed by
securing the stable-base enlargements of the soil maps to a light
table. A scan overlay made of stable-base material was registered
to the topographic base map.  The topographic base and scan overlay
were then positioned on top of the soil map and were adjusted until
the base map features were aligned with the same features on the
soil map. The soil delineations, soil symbols, and special soil
features were compiled on the scan overlay in North American Datum
of 1927 using black colored pencil.  The soils and special soil
features of Akron quarter quadrangles were compiled onto a stable-
base overlay with the 3.75 minute orthophotographic quadrangle used
as a reference.  The Akron quarter quadrangles were compiled in
North American Datum of 1983.  The 3.75 minute orthophotographic
quadrangles were used to compile the water bodies and double line
streams for all of Genesee County. The 3.75 minute
orthophotographic quadrangles was also used to adjust soil lines
adjacent to water bodies and double line streams.  Soil lines
adjustment to hydrology was not performed at this time but will in
the soil survey update for Genesee County.  Land use changes were
also adjusted using the orthophotography as a base for gravel and
quarry pits, and for areas of urban development.  Errors from the
published soil survey were corrected and map unit boundaries were
refined as needed to the topographic image and/or the
orthophotographic image.  Quality control was performed in Maine by
NRCS soil scientists and cartographic technicians.  Final editing
and additional quality control was completed by a NRCS soil
scientist in New York.

The soil delineation overlays were raster
scanned by Midwest Graphics, Kenosha, Wisconsin at 250 dpi on an
Intergraph Anatech scanner in rlc format. Four control points
corresponding to the four corners on the 3.75 minute quadrangles
were used for registration during data collection.  The processing,
raster editing, map neatline development, labeling, edge matching,
vector conversion and editing were done in LT4X Version 4.13 at
U.S. Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation
Service, Wisconsin Digitizing Unit, Madison, Wisconsin.  The
county boundaries were manually digitized from the USGS 7.5 minute
topographic quadrangles and refined to the 3.75 minute
orthophotographic quadrangles in LT4X Version 4.13 on a Sun UNIX
Workstation and exported and snapped together using GRASS Version
4.13 and then imported back into LT4X.  The special soil features
were manually digitized from the 3.75 minute soil delineation
overlays in LT4X Version 4.13 at a resolution of at least 0.01
inch.  The Akron quarter quadrangles were converted from North
American Datum of 1983 to North American Datum of 1927 in LT4X
Version 4.13.  Check plots of the soils and special soil features
data were reviewed by a soil scientist and cartographic staff at
the Wisconsin Digitizing Unit.  Quality assurance was performed at
the NRCS MLRA office in Amherst, Massachusetts.  The soils and
special soil features data were run through a series of LT4X macros
for correctness and completeness.  These macros smoothed out and
thinned out linework, added nodes for every 3000 vertices, added
corner nodes and snapped nodes across the neatlines.  The special
soil features data were run through an additional LT4X macro.  The
digital soils and special soil features data were then exported as
Digital Line Graph-3 Optional format files in LT4X.  The DLG-3
Optional format files were evaluated with the October 1998 ARC/INFO
SSURGO Evaluation AMLs provided by U.S. Department of Agriculture,
Natural Resources Conservation Service, National Cartography and
Geospatial Center, Fort Worth, Texas.  Upon successful of the
SSURGO Evaluation, the DLGs were rewritten from the ARC/INFO
Version 7.11.  The ARC/INFO version DLGs were rechecked with the
October 1998 ARC/INFO SSURGO Evaluation AMLs provided by National
Cartography and Geospatial Center.  The North American Datum of
1927 soils and special soil features quarter quadrangles were
merged into full county coverages for UTM Zone 17 and Zone 18.
Each zone was then clipped to full quadrangles in North American
Datum of 1927 and new DLGs were created.  These procedures were run
in ARC/INFO Version 7.1.1 on a Sun UNIX platform.  The full
quadrangle DLGs were rewritten from ARC/INFO Version 7.1.1 and run
again through the October 1998 SSURGO Evaluation AMLs.  Upon
successful completion the full quadrangle DLGs were processed with
the October 1998 archiving AMLs provided by National Cartography
and Geospatial Center.

The original soil survey of Genesee County was updated with the
majority of the field work completed between 1998 and 2002.
Field work and database edits were performed by the USDA-NRCS
MLRA Project Leader for western New York.  Final field review for
the update work was held on 1/16/2004, with final correlation
being held in 3/2004.  The purpose of the update work was to
bring the field mapping, soil classification and soil correlation
up to modern standards to better meet modern soil information needs.
This work consisted largely of:
separating dual-drainage map units;
extending pedon descriptions to a depth of 72 inches or to bedrock;
correlating modern soil series in place of phases that were
mapped in the original survey;
and incorporating updated mapping of some farmed muck areas
where the organic materials have become much shallower over
mineral soil than when the original soil survey was completed.

These changes were then compiled onto plots of the original
SSURGO data, and digitized by the Pennsylvania USDA-NRCS Map
Compilation and Digitizing Center.  Additionally, the
Digitizing Center adjusted water bodies, expanded quarries and
gravel pits, and adjusted some soil lines to better fit the
DOQQ photo image.
A quality assurance edit of the updated electronic spatial data
was performed at the MO-12 office in Amherst, MA.  Final hard
copy edits were completed at the MLRA Project Office in
Belmont, NY and were digitized by the Pennsylvania USDA-NRCS
Map Compilation and Digitizing Center. The completed digital
product was submitted to the Wisconsin Digitizing Center in
August 2004 for SSURGO review.

NY Soils staff reviewed water polygons and adjacent soil polygons in the
existing SSURGO spatial data against the 1969 hardcopy soil survey atlas
sheets and the 2009 NAIP imagery. The digital mapping was revised where
water polygons were determined to be ponded soil, so that the spatial
data corresponds more closely with the original hard copy atlas sheets.
Some edits to other polygons were made based on the imagery and atlas
sheets.

The MIDU staff checked the spatial data with the ARCGIS Version 9.2
software. The boundaries of this soil survey were adjusted to match the
adjacent soil surveys. To remove excess vertices, the soil boundaries
were generalized at a 0.5 meter tolerance. After the soil survey was
edited, the area, line and point feature classes were converted to
ARC/INFO coverages and exported as e00 files. The digital maps of the
mapping units and the special soil features were imported into the
ARC/INFO Version 7.2.1 software for review and certification. The MIDU
staff checked the data with a set of ARC Macro Language (AML) programs
developed by the NCGC. The seamless coverages were checked using the
January 2006 SSURGO Evaluation AML programs. Upon successful completion
of the SSURGO Evaluation, the county coverages, feature file and
the metadata were electronically transferred to the NRCS Staging
Server to be joined with the tabular data.

The spatial data for Genesee County, New York soil survey area was
downloaded from the Soil Data Mart on October 15, 2012.  The individual
shapefiles were appended into a geodatabase for region 12.  The data were
processed in ARCGIS 10.1 using a topology object with a 0.1 meter cluster
tolerance for the purpose of eliminating gaps and overlaps within the
region 12 soils geodatabase.  Individual soil survey area data were
exported as shapefiles from the regional geodatabase.  A datum
transformation from NAD83 to WGS84 using the NAD_1983_To_WGS_1984_1 datum
transformation method was applied to the data.  The data were checked with
the SSURGO Evaluation scripts provided by U.S. Department of Agriculture,
Natural Resources Conservation Service. The shapefiles were then uploaded
to the soil data warehouse for archival and distribution.

Map Unit Delineations are closed polygons that may be dominated
by a single soil or miscellaneous area component plus allowable
similar or dissimilar soils, or they can be geographic mixtures
of groups of soils or soils and miscellaneous areas.

The map unit symbol uniquely identifies each closed map unit
delineation. Each symbol corresponds to a map unit name. The
map unit key is used to link to information in the National
Soil Information System tables.

Map Unit Delineations are described by the National Soil
Information System database. This attribute database gives the
proportionate extent of the component soils and the properties for
each soil. The database contains both estimated and measured data
on the physical and chemical soil properties and soil
interpretations for engineering, water management, recreation,
agronomic, woodland, range, and wildlife uses of the soil.

The National Soil Information System database contains static
metadata. It documents the data structure and includes such
information as what tables, columns, indexes, and relationships
are defined as well as a variety of attributes of each of these
database objects. Attributes include table and column
descriptions and detailed domain information.

The National Soil Information System database also contains a
distribution metadata. It records the criteria used for selecting
map units and components for inclusion in the set of distributed
data.

Special features are described in the feature table.  It includes an
area symbol, feature label, feature name, and feature description for
each special and ad hoc feature in the survey area.
