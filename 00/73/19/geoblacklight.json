These sites are in NAWQA's fixed network and (or) in a bed sediment and tissue network.  This data set was created to display NAWQA's major surface-water sampling sites identified as part of a fixed network and (or) a bed sediment and tissue network. The points were generated from the latitude and longitude coordinates in the U.S. Geological Survey's National Water Information System (NWIS) for the selected stations.",
