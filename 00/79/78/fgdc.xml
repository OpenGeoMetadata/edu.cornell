    <descript>
      <abstract>These GIS files represent geographic boundaries for lands that are under the
        protection of NYS Agricultural District Law, administered by the New York State Department
        of Agriculture and Markets. The boundaries are derived from New York State Agricultural
        District, 1:24,000-scale, maps produced at county agencies. The district boundaries
        correspond to tax parcel data. District boundaries are joined into a file representing all
        of the Agricultural Districts within an entire county. Note that 2003 legislation allows
        lands to be added to districts on an annual basis. Electronic data provided here may predate
        those additions. Tax parcel detail and secondary rights-of-way are not included in this
        dataset. Rights-of-way for state and federal highways, railroads and utilities are only
        included when they are delineated on the original 1:24,000 scale maps. The data files are in
        ArcGIS shapefile format.</abstract>
      <purpose>A Geographic Information System (ArcGIS) file intended to represent the lands within
        agricultural district. Please note that boundaries may be generalizations; precise
        information can be obtained from the county or town tax parcel information.</purpose>
      <supplinf>An Agricultural District is defined by a list of tax parcels, including properties
        added during the annual open enrollment. The 1:24,000-scale maps are only updated to reflect
        open enrollment changes at the eight-year renewal of the district. The electronic data only
        reflects changes to the 1:24,000-scale maps. The Agricultural District boundaries are for
        use in conjunction with NYS geographical data (ex. NYS Department of Transportation (DOT)
        7.5' planimetric data).  Boundary data is current to certification date of the district map
        on file at IRIS at the time the digital data was updated. The certification date is noted in
        the attribute table field called "Certified". Legislation in 2003 allows lands to be added
        to districts on an annual basis. Electronic data provided here may predate those additions.
        Refer to the current tax parcel list for each district to confirm the precise agricultural
        district boundary. For more information about NYS Agricultural Districts, see

    <datacred>Cornell IRIS maintains the county produced Agricultural District maps on file under
      contract with the New York State Department of Agriculture and Markets. In 1996 the maps on
      file at Cornell IRIS (then CLEARS) were scanned at the NYSDEC as the initial step in creating
      a digital database of Ag District Boundaries.</datacred>

    <logic>Boundary data reflect Agricultural District boundaries as displayed on 1:24,000-scale
      maps. When boundaries show areas contained mutually in more than one district in the same
      county, electronic data reflect this as an overlap. If individual tax parcels are dissolved to
      form an aggregate boundary, slivers and gaps may be formed by drafting discrepancies. These
      are visually compared to the map and eliminated when they do not represent intended
      exclusions. If the map is unclear, the county is contacted to confirm intent. District
      boundary shapefile data is printed out using DOT planimetric raster data as a base, then
      proofread against the maps.</logic>
    <complete>County Agricultural District boundaries are complete to the extent that the original
      map is complete. Tax parcel detail and secondary rights-of-way are not included in this
      dataset. Rights-of-way for state and federal highways, railroads and utilities are only
      included when they are delineated on the original 1:24,000 scale maps. NOTE: The most current
      and precise boundary of a district should be verified by referring to the tax parcel
      information.</complete>

        <procdesc>1) ORIGINAL SCAN PROJECT In 1996, the entire set of NYS Agricultural District maps
          in the collection of Cornell IRIS (originally CLEARS) was converted to digital format.
          This was done by shipping blueprint copies of the maps to the NYS DEC for scanning.
          Digital Line Graph files were returned, which were converted to ArcInfo Coverages. These
          coverages represented one map sheet apiece. Original maps with multiple sheets were
          represented by multiple coverages. Coverages were compared to the original maps and edited
          as necessary to create an accurate representation of the Ag District boundaries shown on
          the maps. After accuracy was confirmed, coverages representing multiple sheets were merged
          to create district coverages. Districts were then merged to create county coverages.
          Merged districts sometimes created slivers, which were eliminated, and gaps, which are
          flagged with district value of zero. Overlaps between districts also occurred in a few
          cases. These were flagged with district value "66". For each coverage, an attribute table
          was built to record the information shown on the Cornell IRIS title block of each Ag
          District hardcopy map. These tables are further described in the Entity and Attribute
          Information section of the metadata.</procdesc>

        <procdesc>2) CONVERSION FROM COVERAGES TO SHAPEFILES: Internal polygons were labeled zero;
          coverages were reprojected from UTMz18 NAD27 to UTMz18 NAD83; Coverages were converted to
          shapefiles; zero polygons were deleted; attribute table was modified: deleted fields are
          AREA, PERIMETER, FILE#, FILE_ID, AGDIST#, DOTQUADS. Modified fields are DISTCODE and
          DISTRICT. DISTCODE is 12 characters to accommodate changing abbreviations -- currently
          four characters and three digits to represent a key code for county name and district
          number. The field DISTRICT was enlarged to accommodate district numbers up to five digits.
          Also, DISTCODE, the key field, was moved to the end of the attribute table
          columns.</procdesc>

        <procdesc>3) The county provided a shapefile for all of their districts, which were modified
          to match the rest of the dataset, replacing the original coverages. The attribute table
          was reformatted to same structure as the rest of the NYS Agricultural District shapefiles.
          Other modifications included reprojecting the data and dissolving internal parcel lines to
          create an aggregate boundary for each district. When individual tax parcels were dissolved
          to form an aggregate boundary, slivers and gaps may be formed by drafting discrepancies.
          These are visually compared to the map and eliminated when they do not represent intended
          exclusions. Each district boundary were checked against the certified district map to
          confirm consistency. Any annual open-enrollment parcels added since the most recent 8-year
          review certification are not included in this dataset, even if they are included in the
          original county-supplied shapefile. Attributes are updated and checked against the
          information on the map title blocks, as well as information on file. Discrepancies between
          the title block information and file information are clarified by contacting the county
          and/or New York State Department of Agriculture and Markets.</procdesc>
