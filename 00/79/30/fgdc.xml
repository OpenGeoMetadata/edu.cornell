      <abstract>
This data set is a digital soil survey and generally is the most
detailed level of soil geographic data developed by the National
Cooperative Soil Survey. The information was prepared by digitizing
maps, by compiling information onto a planimetric correct base
and digitizing, or by revising digitized maps using remotely
sensed and other information.

This data set consists of georeferenced digital map data and
computerized attribute data. The map data are in a soil survey area
extent format and include a detailed, field verified inventory
of soils and miscellaneous areas that normally occur in a repeatable
pattern on the landscape and that can be cartographically shown at
the scale mapped. A special soil features layer (point and line
features) is optional. This layer displays the location of features
too small to delineate at the mapping scale, but they are large
enough and contrasting enough to significantly influence use and
management. The soil map units are linked to attributes in the
National Soil Information System relational database, which gives
the proportionate extent of the component soils and their properties.
</abstract>
      <purpose>
SSURGO depicts information about the kinds and distribution of
soils on the landscape. The soil map and data used in the SSURGO
product were prepared by soil scientists as part of the National
Cooperative Soil Survey.
</purpose>
      <supplinf>
Digital versions of hydrography, cultural features, and other
associated layers that are not part of the SSURGO data set may be
available from the primary organization listed in the Point of
Contact.

This data set is not designed for use as a primary regulatory tool
in permitting or citing decisions, but may be used as a reference
source. This is public information and may be interpreted by
organizations, agencies, units of government, or others based on
needs; however, they are responsible for the appropriate

reassign to the Natural Resources Conservation Service any
authority for the decisions that they make. The Natural Resources
Conservation Service will not perform any evaluations of these maps
for purposes related solely to State or local regulatory programs.

Photographic or digital enlargement of these maps to scales greater
than at which they were originally mapped can cause misinterpretation
of the data. If enlarged, maps do not show the small areas of
contrasting soils that could have been shown at a larger scale. The
depicted soil boundaries, interpretations, and analysis derived from
them do not eliminate the need for onsite sampling, testing, and
detailed study of specific sites for intensive uses. Thus, these data
and their interpretations are intended for planning purposes only.
Digital data files are periodically updated. Files are dated, and
users are responsible for obtaining the latest version of the data.

The attribute accuracy is tested by manual
comparison of the source with hard copy plots and/or symbolized
display of the map data on an interactive computer graphic system.
Selected attributes that cannot be visually verified on plots or
on screen are interactively queried and verified on screen. In
addition, the attributes are tested against a master set of valid
attributes. All attribute data conform to the attribute codes in
the signed classification and correlation document and amendment(s).

Certain node/geometry and topology GT- polygon/chain relationships
are collected or generated to satisfy topological requirements
(the GT-polygon corresponds to the soil delineation). Some of these
requirements include: chains must begin and end at nodes, chains
must connect to each other at nodes, chains do not extend through
nodes, left and right GT-polygons are defined for each chain
element and are consistent throughout, and the chains representing
the limits of the file are free of gaps. The tests of logical
consistency are performed using vendor software. All internal
polygons are tested for closure with vendor software and are checked
on hard copy plots. All data are checked for common soil lines (i.e.,
adjacent polygons with the same label). Edge locations generally do
not deviate from centerline to centerline by more than 0.01 inch.

Quadrangles are edge matched within the soil survey area and edge locations
generally do not deviate from centerline to centerline by more than 0.01
inch.

The quadrangles in this survey are edge matched to quadrangles in adjacent
SSURGO certified soil surveys Cattaraugus, Livingston, Steuben and Wyoming
Counties, New York, Seneca Nation of Indians, New York and McKean and Potter
Counties, Pennsylvania and the survey area boundaries match.

Most feature edges (polygon and line segments) match adjacent ones in
the edge matched survey area, however, most feature labels don't match
the adjacent feature labels in the edge matched survey.

A map unit is a collection of areas defined and named in terms of
their soil components or miscellaneous areas or both. Each map
unit differs in some respect from all others in a survey area and
each map unit has a symbol that uniquely identifies the map unit
on a soil map. Each individual area, point, or line so identified
on the map is a delineation.

Soil Scientists identify small areas of soils or miscellaneous areas
that have properties and behavior significantly different than the
named soils in the surrounding map unit. These minor components
may be indicated as special features. If they have a minimal effect
on use and management, or could not be precisely located, they may
not be indicated on the map.

A map unit has specified kinds of soils or miscellaneous areas
(map unit components), each with a designated range in
proportionate extent. Map units include one or more kinds of soil
or miscellaneous area. Miscellaneous areas are areas that have little
or no recognizable soil.

Specific National Cooperative Soil Survey standards and procedures
were used in the classification of soils, design and name of map
units, and location of special soil features. These standards are
outlined in Agricultural Handbook 18, Soil Survey Manual, 1993,
USDA, NRCS; Agricultural Handbook 436, Soil Taxonomy, 1995,
USDA, NRCS; and all Amendments; Keys to Soil Taxonomy,
(current issue) USDA, NRCS; National Soil Survey
Handbook, title 430-VI,(current issue) USDA, NRCS.

The actual composition and interpretive purity of the map unit
delineations were based on data collected by scientists during
the course of preparing the soil maps. Adherence to National
Cooperative Soil Survey standards and procedures is based on
peer review, quality control, and quality assurance. Quality
control is outlined in the memorandum of understanding for the
soil survey area and in documents that reside with the Natural
Resources Conservation Service state soil scientist. Four kinds
of map units are used in soil surveys: consociations, complexes,
associations, and undifferentiated groups.

Consociations - Consociations are named for the dominant soil.
In a consociation, delineated areas use a single name from the
dominant component in the map unit. Dissimilar components are
minor in extent. The soil component in a consociation may be
identified at any taxonomic level. Soil series is the lowest
taxonomic level. A consociation that is named as a miscellaneous
area is dominantly that kind of area and minor components do not
significantly affect the use of the map unit. The total amount of
dissimilar inclusions of other components in a map unit generally
does not exceed about 15 percent if limiting and 25 percent if
nonlimiting. A single component of a dissimilar limiting inclusion
generally does not exceed 10 percent if very contrasting.

Complexes and associations - Complexes and associations consist
of two or more  dissimilar components that occur in a regularly
repeating pattern. The total amount of other dissimilar components
is minor extent. The following arbitrary rule determines whether
complex or association is used in the name. The major components
of an association can be separated at the scale of mapping. In
either case, because the major components are sufficiently different
in morphology or behavior, the map unit cannot be called a
consociation. In each delineation of a complex or an association,
each major component is normally present though their proportions
may vary appreciably from one delineation to another. The total
amount of inclusions in a map unit that are dissimilar to any of
the major components does not exceed 15 percent if limiting and
25 percent if nonlimiting. A single kind of dissimilar limiting
inclusion usually does not exceed 10 percent.

Undifferentiated groups - Undifferentiated groups consist of two
or more components that are not consistently associated
geographically and, therefore, do not always occur together in
the same map delineation. These components are included in the
same named map unit because their use and management are the same
or very similar for common uses. Generally they are grouped together
because some common feature, such as steepness, stoniness, or
flooding, determines their use and management. If two or more
additional map units would serve no useful purpose, they may be
included in the same unit. Each delineation has at least one of the
major components, and some may have all of them. The same principles
regarding the proportion of minor components that apply to
consociations also apply to undifferentiated groups. The same
principles regarding proportion of inclusion apply to
undifferentiated groups as to consociations.

Minimum documentation consists of three complete soil profile
descriptions that are collected for each soil added to the legend,
one additional per 3,000 acres mapped; three 10 observation
transects for each map unit, one additional 10 point transect per
3,000 acres.

A defined standard or level of confidence in the interpretive
purity of the map unit delineations is attained by adjusting the
kind and intensity of field investigations. Field investigations
and data collection are carried out in sufficient detail to name
map units and to identify accurately and consistently areas of about
5 acres in the Order 2 mapping and about 40 acres in Order 3 mapping.
The order of mapping can be distinguished by the map unit symbols:
Order 2 map units have an alphabetic symbol and Order 3 map units
have a numeric symbol with alphabetic slope class symbol.

The accuracy of these digital data is based upon their
compilation to base maps that meet National Map
Accuracy Standards at a scale of 1 inch equals 1,000
feet. The difference in positional accuracy between the
soil boundaries and special soil features locations in the
field and their digitized map locations is unknown. The
locational accuracy of soil delineations on the ground varies
with the transition between map units.

For example, on long gently sloping landscapes the transition
occurs gradually over many feet. Where landscapes change
abruptly from steep to level, the transition will be very
narrow. Soil delineation boundaries and special soil features
generally were digitized within 0.01 inch of their locations on
the digitizing source. The digital map elements are edge matched
between data sets. The data along each quadrangle edge are
matched against the data for the adjacent quadrangle. Edge
locations generally do not deviate from centerline to centerline
by more than 0.01 inch.

The Soil Survey of Allegany County, New York began in
the year 1993.  The survey area is being mapped at a scale of 1:24000.
Procedures for mapping consist of intensive field investigation in
conjunction with remote sensing of imagery.  Boundaries of delineations
are verified by traversing the landscape at closely spaced intervals.
Map unit composition is confirmed by transecting representative areas.
Field mapping is ongoing; approximately 55% of the survey area is
included in this advance copy data set.

Field maps were manually compiled to
1:24000 scale, using 7.5 minute orthophoto quadrangles.  The soil
delineation overlays were created by compiling the soil lines
to a stable-base material pin registered to the orthophoto
quadrangle.  The soil delineation overlays were raster scanned by
Midwest Graphics, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, on an Intergraph Anatech scanner
at 250 dpi in rlc format.  The county borders digitized on screen
7.5 minute USGS DRG in ESRI ArcMap 8.3 and a DOQ mosaic.  The raster
editing, labeling, edge matching, and vector conversion for the soils
and special soil features were done in LT4X Version 4.02 for the
following quadrangles by the Wisconsin Digitizing Unit, USDA, Natural
Resources Conservation Service, Madison, Wisconsin (WIDU):
Bliss, Pike, Portageville, Freedom, Houghton, Fillmore, Rawson, Black
Creek, Angelica, Cuba, Portville, Bullis Mills, Wellsville South,
Whitesville, Rexville, Ellisburg, and Ulysses.
Compilation, digitizing, and quality control were by USDA-NRCS, Belmont
Service Center, Belmont, NY Soil Survey Project Leader and the WIDU.
The soils data were written to a Digital Line Graph Optional Format
using LT4X. The DLG Optional files were evaluated with the February
1998 ARC/INFO AMLs provided by USDA-NRCS, National Cartography
and Geospatial Center, Fort Worth, Texas (NCGC).  Upon successful
completion of the SSURGO evaluation the data were merged from quadrangle
format into a single area patch.

Compilation, and digitizing quality control were by USDA-NRCS, Belmont
Service Center, Belmont, NY Soil Survey Project Leader and the WIDU. A
pen plot review of what is currently digitized was performed by the
WIDU. The data were then joined with the previously developed
quadrangles into a single area patch and submitted to the New York state
office for use.  The data were evaluated with the U.S. Department of
Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation Service, National
Cartography and Geospatial Center, archiving AMLs.  Upon completion of
the archiving AMLs the data was sent to New York.  This data is not
intended for distribution to the general public.

For the quadrangles of Nunda and Bridsall, field maps
were manually compiled to 1:24000 scale, using 7.5 minute orthophoto
quadrangles.  The soil delineation overlays were created by compiling
the soil lines to a stable-base material pin registered to the
orthophoto quadrangle.  The 7.5 minute soil map unit delineation and
label overlays were raster scanned by Midwest Graphics, Kenosha,
Wisconsin at 250 dpi on an Intergraph Anatech scanner in tiff
uncompressed format.  The data were sent to the Wisconsin Digitizing
Unit in Madison, Wisconsin.  Four control points that, corresponded to
the four corners on the 7.5 minute quadrangles were, used for
registration during data collection.  The tiff files were imported into
ArcGIS 9.1 ArcMap.  The tiff files were georeferenced in ArcMap.  Using
the raster cleanup tools, the tiff files were cleaned, edge-matched and
vectorized to a polygon feature class.  Using the label overlay tiff
files as a back drop, the soil polygons were attributed and line and
point features classes were digitized and labeled.  Compilation and
digitizing quality control were done by USDA-NRCS, Belmont Service
Center, Belmont, NY Soil Survey Project Leader and the WIDU. A pen plot
review of what is currently digitized was performed by the WIDU. The
data were then joined with the previously developed quadrangles into a
single area patch.  Using topology rules, errors were identified and
corrected.  The data were then exported to polygon, line, and point
coverages using Arc Catalog.  Next, the data were then projected
to Geographic coordinates in decimal degrees and run through the 20040524
ReCert AMLs provided by NCGC and uploaded to the Soil Data Warehouse for
archival and distribution.

Soil delineations in Potter Co., Pennsylvania were
snapped to the end nodes of Allegany Co. and the both state lines were
adjusted to be straight and match perfectly.  Minor corrections to soil
delineations within Allegany were made in conference between the Soil
Survey Project Leaders for the survey areas using slope maps generated
from 10 meter digital elevation models and the most recent
orthophotographic imagery.  Corrections and adjustments to both counties
were completed at the Pennsylvania Map Compilation and Digitizing Center
in University Park, PA.  The data were then run through the 20040524
ReCert AMLs provided by NCGC and uploaded to the Soil Data Warehouse for

Field maps were manually compiled to 1:24000 scale,
using 7.5 minute orthophoto quadrangles.  The soil delineation overlays
were created by compiling the soil lines to a stable-base material pin,
registered to the orthophoto quadrangle.  The soil delineation overlays
were raster scanned by the Wisconsin Digitizing Unit, Madison, Wisconsin
on a Graphtec, CS500 Pro Scanner at 250 dpi in tif format.  The vector
editing, labeling, and edge matching for the soils and special soil
features were done in ArcGIS Version 9.2 for the following quadrangle
by the Wisconsin Digitizing Unit, USDA, Natural Resources Conservation
Service, Madison, Wisconsin (WIDU): Alfred Compilation and digitizing
quality control were by USDA-NRCS, Belmont Service Center, Belmont, NY
Soil Survey Project Leader and the WIDU.  The new data were then joined
with the existing SSURGO dataset into a single area patch.  In the
previous version it was determined that the 100D (Udorthents, loamy
skeletal 0 to 25 percent slopes) unit was not adequate for the entire
survey area.  This Map unit needed to be subdivided to separate out the
Udorthents formed from glacial outwash gravel soils and those formed
from upland glacial till. The upland glacial till areas now have a
symbol of  200D (Udorthents, loamy,  0 to 25 % slopes).  These area
occur mostly in the upland areas along Interstate 86 where material was
borrowed for fill material, and on the campuses of Alfred University and
Alfred State College.
The 34A map unit was originally mapped as Getzville and was mapped as
very poorly and poorly drained.  It was decided to change the map unit
name to Atherton and make it poorly drained.  Any map units of 34A that
were very poorly drained were changed to map unit 39A (which used to be
called Halsey, but after gathering data, now is our map unit of very
poorly drained Atherton).  The data was processed through the 20040524
certification AMLs provided by the National Cartographic and Geospatial
Center in Ft. Worth, TX.  Upon successful completion through the AMLs,
the data was uploaded to the Data Mart.

Map Unit Delineations are closed polygons that may be dominated
by a single soil or miscellaneous area component plus allowable
similar or dissimilar soils, or they can be geographic mixtures
of groups of soils or soils and miscellaneous areas.

The map unit symbol uniquely identifies each closed map unit
delineation. Each symbol corresponds to a map unit name. The
map unit key is used to link to information in the National
Soil Information System tables.

Map Unit Delineations are described by the National Soil
Information System database. This attribute database gives the
proportionate extent of the component soils and the properties for
each soil. The database contains both estimated and measured data
on the physical and chemical soil properties and soil
interpretations for engineering, water management, recreation,
agronomic, woodland, range, and wildlife uses of the soil.

The National Soil Information System database contains static
metadata. It documents the data structure and includes such
information as what tables, columns, indexes, and relationships
are defined as well as a variety of attributes of each of these
database objects. Attributes include table and column
descriptions and detailed domain information.

The National Soil Information System database also contains a
distribution metadata. It records the criteria used for selecting
map units and components for inclusion in the set of distributed
data.

Special features are described in the feature table.  It includes an
area symbol, feature label, feature name, and feature description for
each special and ad hoc feature in the survey area.
