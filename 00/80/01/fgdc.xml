      <abstract>The National Land Cover Database (NLCD) 1992 Land Cover layer was produced through a cooperative project conducted by the Multi-Resolution Land Characteristics (MRLC) Consortium.  The MRLC Consortium is a partnership of federal agencies (www.mrlc.gov), consisting of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the U.S. Department of Agriculture - Forest Service (USDA-FS), the National Park Service (NPS), the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS).  
One of the primary goals of the project is to generate a current, consistent, seamless, and accurate land cover data for the United States at medium spatial resolution.  Questions about the NLCD can be directed to the NLCD land cover mapping team at USGS EROS, Sioux Falls, SD (605)594-6151 or mrlc@usgs.gov.</abstract>
      <purpose>The goal of this project is to provide the Nation with complete, current and consistent public domain information on its land use and land cover.</purpose>

      <attraccr>The accuracy of the 1992 National Land-Cover Data (NLCD) map was assessed via a probability sampling design incorporating three levels of stratification and two stages of selection. Agreement between the map and reference land-cover labels is defined as a match between the primary or alternate reference label determined for a sample pixel and a mode class of the mapped 3x3 block of pixels centered on the sample pixel. See Stehman et al, 2003 and Wickham et al., 2004 for details.</attraccr>
      <qattracc>
        <attraccv>78.7</attraccv>
        <attracce>An accuracy assessment was done on all NLCD on a Federal Region basis following a revision cycle that incorporates feedback from MRLC Consortium partners and affiliated users.  The accuracy assessments are conducted by private sector vendors under contract to the USEPA.A protocol has been established by the USGS and USEPA that incorporatesa two-stage, geographically stratified cluster sampling plan (Zhu et al., 1999) utilizing National Aerial Photography Program (NAPP) photographs as the sampling frame and the basic sampling unit.  In this design a NAPP photograph is defined as a 1st stage or primary sampling unit (PSU), and a sampled pixel within each PSU is treated as a 2nd stage or secondary sampling unit (SSU).

PSU's are selected from a sampling grid based on NAPP flight-lines and photo centers, each grid cell measures 15' X 15' (minutes of latitude/longitude) and consists of 32 NHAP photographs.  A geographically stratified random sampling is performed with 1 NAPP photo being randomly selected from each cell (geographic strata), if a sampled photo falls outside of the regional boundary it is not used.  Second stage sampling is accomplished by selecting SSU's (pixels) within each PSU (NAPP photo) to provide the actual locations for the reference land cover classification.

The SSU's are manually interpreted and misclassification errors are estimated and described using a traditional error matrix as well as a number of other important measures including the overall proportion of pixels correctly classified, user's and producer's accuracies, and omission and commission error probabilities.</attracce>

    <logic>An unsupervised classification algorithm was used to classify the mosaicked multiple leaf-off TM scenes.  Aerial photographs were used to interpret and label classes into land cover categories and ancillary data sources resolved the class confusion.  Further land cover information from leaf-on TM data, NWI data, and other sources were incorporated to refine and augment the "basic" classification.</logic>

      <procstep>
        <procdesc>The project is being carried out on the basis of 10 Federal Regions that make up the conterminous United States; each region is comprised of multiple states; each region is processed in subregional units that are limited to the area covered by no more than 18 Landsat TM scenes. The general NLCD procedure is to: (1) mosaic subregional TM scenes and classify them using an unsupervised clustering algorithm, (2) interpret and label the clusters/classes using aerial photographs as reference data, (3) resolve the labeling of confused clusters/classes using the appropriate  ancillary data source(s), and (4) incorporate land cover information from other data sets and perform manual edits to augment and refine the "basic" classification developed above.

Two seasonally distinct TM mosaics are produced, a leaves-on version (summer) and a leaves-off (spring/fall) version.  TM bands 3, 4, 5, and 7 are mosaicked for both the leaves-on and leaves-off versions. For mosaick purposes, a base scene is selected for each mosaic and the other scenes are adjusted to mimic spectral properties of the base scene using histogram matching in regions of spatial overlap. Following mosaicking, either the leaves-off version or leaves-on version is selected to be the "base" for the land cover mapping process.  The 4 TM bands of the "base" mosaic are clustered to produce a single 100- class image using an unsupervised clustering algorithm. Each of the spectrally distinct clusters/classes is then assigned to one or more Anderson level 1 and 2 land cover classes using National High Altitude Photography program (NHAP)and National Aerial Photography program (NAPP) aerial photographs as a reference.  Almost invariably, individual spectral clusters/classes are confused between two or more land cover classes.

Separation of the confused spectral clusters/classes into appropriate NLCD class is accomplished using ancillary data layers.  Standard ancillary data layers include: the "non-base" mosaic TM bands and 100- class cluster image; derived TM normalized vegetation index (NDVI), various TM band ratios, TM date bands; 3-arc second Digital Terrain Elevation Data (DTED) and derived slope, aspect and shaded relief; population and housing density data; USGS land use and land cover (LUDA); and National Wetlands Inventory(NWI) data if available. Other ancillary data sources may include soils data, unique state or regional land cover data sets, or data from other federal programs such as the National Gap Analysis Program (GAP) of the USGS Biological Resources Division (BRD).  For a given confused spectral cluster/class, digital values of the various ancillary data layers are compared to determine: (1) which data layers are the most effective for splitting the confused cluster/class into the appropriate NLCD class, and (2) the appropriate layer thresholds for making the split(s).  Models are then developed using one to several ancillary data layers to split the confused cluster/class into the NLCD class.  For example, a population density threshold is used to separate high-intensity residential areas from commercial/industrial/transportation.  Or a cluster/class might be confused between row crop and grasslands.  To split this particular cluster/class, a TM NDVI threshold might be identified and used with an elevation threshold in a class-splitting model to make the appropriate NLCD class assignments.  A purely spectral example is using the temporally opposite TM layers to discriminate confused cluster/classes such as hay pasture vs. row crops and deciduous forests vs. evergreen forests; simple thresholds that contrast the seasonal differences in vegetation between leaves-on vs. leaves-off.

Not all cluster/class confusion can be successfully modeled out. Certain classes such as urban/recreational grasses or quarries/strip mines/gravel pits that are not spectrally unique require manual editing. These class features are typically visually identified and then reclassified using on-screen digitizing and recoding.  Other classes such as wetlands require the use of specific data sets such as NWI to provide the most accurate classification.  Areas lacking NWI data are typically subset out and modeling is used to estimate wetlands in these localized areas.  The final NLCD product results from the classification (interpretation and labeling) of the 100-class "base" cluster mosaic using both automated and manual processes, incorporating both spectral and conditional data layers.

            <edomvd>Shrubland - Areas dominated by shrubs; shrub canopy accounts for 25-100 percent of the cover. Shrub cover is generally greater than 25 percent when tree cover is less than 25 percent. Shrub cover may be less than 25 percent in cases when the cover of other life forms (e.g. herbaceous or tree) is less than 25 percent and shrubs cover exceeds the cover of the other life forms.</edomvd>
