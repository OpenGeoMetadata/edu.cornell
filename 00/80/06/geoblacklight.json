The boundaries represent the one-to-one match with the parcel boundaries shown on the final paper maps for a given year.  The parcel boundaries represent legal descriptions of property ownership, as recorded in various public documents in the Tompkins County Clerk's Office. This is the New-York-State-mandated database of property ownership and information in Tompkins County. This database is related to a subset of the RPS database extract using the SWISPRINTK field.
