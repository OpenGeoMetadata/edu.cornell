    <logic>Topological rules include: Lines must begin and end at nodes, lines do not overshoot or undershoot other lines where they are supposed to meet, there are no duplicate lines, lines may cross without intersection (with no node) when the features do not intersect in reality (cross over/under).</logic>
    <complete>The completeness of the data reflects the published map. Features found on the ground may have been eliminated or generalized on the source graphic because of scale and legibility constraints. In general, streams longer than one mile (approximately 1.6 kilometers) were collected. Most streams that flow from a lake were collected regardless of their length. Note, however, that these general rules were applied unevenly among maps during compilation.</complete>
    <posacc>
      <horizpa>
        <horizpar>Statements of horizontal positional accuracy are based on accuracy statements made for U.S. Geological Survey topographic quadrangle maps. These maps were compiled to meet National Map Accuracy Standards. For horizontal accuracy, this standard is met if at least 90 percent of points tested are within 0.02 inch (at map scale) of the true position. Additional offsets to positions may have been introduced where feature density is high to improve the legibility of map symbols.In addition, the digitizing of maps is estimated to contain a horizontal positional error of less than or equal to 0.003 inch standard error (at map scale) in the two component directions relative to the source maps. Visual comparison between the map graphic (including digital scans of the graphic) and plots or digital displays of points, lines, and areas, is used as control to assess the positional accuracy of digital data.</horizpar>
      </horizpa>
      <vertacc>
        <vertaccr>Statements of vertical positional accuracy for elevation of water surfaces are based on accuracy statements made for U.S. Geological Survey topographic quadrangle maps. These maps were compiled to meet National Map Accuracy Standards. For vertical accuracy, this standard is met if at least 90 percent of well-defined points tested are within one-half contour interval of the correct value. Elevations of water surface printed on the published map meet this standard; the contour intervals of the maps vary. These elevations were transcribed into the digital data; the accuracy of this transcription was checked by visual comparison between the data and the map.</vertaccr>

Map elements along the adjoining edges of data sets joined with connector lines. 2. Flow direction set using ArcInfo Network. Flow direction of isolated or complex features checked and set visually on-screen. Nodes removed on features that cross without intersecting (over/under) 3. Stream names for selected streams added visually using ArcInfo Dynamic Segmentation with the USGS 7.5 Minute Topographic Maps as a backdrop.</procdesc>

    <overview>
      <eaover>The New York State Large Scale Hydrography Network contains attributes which are used internally by ArcInfo, and several pairs of numerical 'major' and 'minor' codes. An ArcInfo route system called STRMNAME contains the names of selected rivers and large streams.</eaover>
      <eadetcit>The numerical major and minor code attributes are included with the data in an INFO table named with the same base name as the data file(s) followed by a ".dlgcodes" extension. A complete listing of the numerical major and minor code attributes and their meaning can be found in the USGS's Standards for Digital Line Graphs at &lt;http://mapping.usgs.gov/standards/&gt;. Note that a few codes are unique to the New York State Large Scale Hydrography Network and will not be found in the USGS's Standards for Digital Line Graphs.</eadetcit>
