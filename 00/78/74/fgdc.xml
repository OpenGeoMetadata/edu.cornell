      <abstract>The active tax parcel boundaries for all of Tompkins County for
        a given year. The boundaries represent the one-to-one match with the
        parcel boundaries shown on the final paper maps for a given year.</abstract>
      <purpose>The parcel boundaries represent legal descriptions of property
        ownership, as recorded in various public documents in the Tompkins
        County Clerk's Office. This is the database of property ownership and
        information in Tompkins County, as mandated by New York State. This
        database can be related to the New York State Office of Real Property
        Services (RPS) database extract using either the SWISPRINTK field or the
        PARCELKEY field.</purpose>
      <supplinf>Properties that are tracked by an account number (utilities,
        railroads, etc.) may be shown as several separate tax parcel boundaries,
        with different tax map print keys, even though they are tracked in the
        RPS database under the same account number and treated as one single
        parcel. The parcel region will show these account-number properties as
        one tax parcel boundary, while the printkey region will show each
        separate tax parcel boundary that is a part of the account number. As of
        2005, the tax parcel boundaries have not been edge-matched by
        municipality, except for Villages within their respective Town. This
        data set is derived from the tax parcel region of all tax parcel data
        sets in Tompkins County and is maintained as a geodatabase featureclass
        by municipality. For property ownership information please contact
      the Tompkins County Assessment Department.</supplinf>

      <procstep>
        <procdesc> Tax parcel boundaries were initially maintained manually on
          mylar originals, using erasable ink. In 1991, a series of planimetric
          base data sets were produced from aerial photography, and are now
          referred to as the 1991 Tompkins County Digital Planimetric Base Map.
          The tax parcel mylar maps were digitized using MapGrafix and
          referenced to the 1991 Tompkins County Digital Planimetric Base Map.
          In 1997, the MapGrafix data sets for the City of Ithaca and the Towns
          of Caroline and Danby were approved by the New York State Office of
          Real Property Services (NYS ORPS). In 1998, the Map Grafix data sets
          were converted to Arc/Info for the City of Ithaca, Towns of Caroline,
          Danby, Dryden, and Ithaca, and the Villages of Cayuga Heights, Dryden,
          and Freeville. In 1999, the Towns of Enfield, Groton, Lansing,
          Newfield, and Ulysses, and the Villages of Groton, Lansing, and
          Trumansburg were converted to Arc/Info. Beginning with the 1999 tax
          year, all tax parcel boundaries were maintained in Arc/Info, all tax
          maps are printed using ArcView, and all tax maps are archived
          digitally using Adobe Acrobat, as well as the traditional paper
          archival. During the transition period from paper to digital maps,
          parcel boundaries were approximated, except for those boundaries that
          have been input using paper surveys and legal descriptions. The tax
          parcel data sets consisted of three groups of layers: boundary layers,
          text layers, and region layers. The boundary layers consisted of those
          Arc/Info feature classes upon which the region layers are created.
          Boundary layers include the nodes, arcs, and polygons. Parcel
          boundaries are changed by first modifying the arc and node layers, and
          updating the arc attributes. Next, the polygons were re-created and
          their attributes were updated. The text layers were then updated to
          reflect the boundary changes. Finally, the regions were created from
          the polygons using polygon attributes and the Arc/Info REGIONDISSOLVE
          command. The text layers are Arc/Info annotation layers and include
          acreage, block, dimension, non-roll section 1 (exempt/utility/state
          lands), lot, Military Tract/Watkins and Flint Purchase, municipality,
          place, road name, special district, tax map, tic mark, and water text,
          as it appears on the printed tax parcel maps. The region layers
          include deed book/page, municipal, parcel, printkey, and tax map
          regions. The printkey regions from each of the municipal data sets for
          the current tax year are then combined into a county-wide data set,
          which is then converted to an ArcView shapefile. Regions for special
          districts were derived from polygon attributes in the same manner as
          the other regions, for each municipality, then combined into a
          County-wide special districts data set. Regions for public lands were
          similiarly combined and converted into a County-wide public lands data
          set. In 2004, the original Arc/Info coverages described above were
          migrated to the ESRI ArcInfo Desktop geodatabase format. Parcel
          boundaries are changed based on deed and survey information and are
          modified in the software using Map topology and several geodatabase
          topology rules to ensure spatial data integrity. All regions,
          annotations, centroids and polygons listed above were sussessfully
          migrated by municipality and are maintained in the ESRI personal
          geodatabase format. Beginning with the 2004 tax year, all tax parcel
          boundaries are maintained in ArcInfo Desktop, all tax maps are printed
          via a special script which outputs the taxmaps to Adobe Acrobat (PDF)
          format. All tax maps are archived digitally using Adobe Acrobat, as
          well as the traditional paper archival. 2005 tax maps in the Adobe PDF
          format can be obtained digitally online at:
